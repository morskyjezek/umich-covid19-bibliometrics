While the US government’s approach to innovation—research funding and patent policies and programs that value scientists’ and private sector freedoms—has been copied around the world due to its apparent success, I argue that it has hurt poor and marginalized communities. It has limited our understanding of health disparities and how to address them, and hampered access to essential technologies due to both lack of coordination and high cost. Fair and equal treatment of vulnerable citizens requires sensitive and dedicated policies that attend explicitly to the fact that the benefits of innovation do not simply trickle down.",,Democratic Theory,,,2020-12-01,2020,7,2,104-109,All OA; Gold,Article,"Parthasarathy, Shobita","Parthasarathy, Shobita (University of Michigan, USA shobita@umich.edu)",,"Parthasarathy, Shobita (University of Michigan)",University of Michigan,grid.214458.e,United States,,0,0,,,35,https://www.berghahnjournals.com/downloadpdf/journals/democratic-theory/7/2/dt070213.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1130781196,1605 Policy and Administration; 16 Studies in Human Society,

Observations: A 28-year-old female tested positive for COVID-19. 19 days later, she developed a fever, rash and a burning sensation in both eyes. Her examination revealed mild ocular inflammation with bilateral eyelid and conjunctival involvement. Skin biopsy favored a diagnosis of toxic shock syndrome. She was initiated on corticosteroid eye drops and her ocular symptoms resolved three days later. Conclusion and importance: Toxic shock syndrome is almost always associated with conjunctival inflammation. To our knowledge, this is the first report of an adult patient with toxic shock syndrome following COVID-19 infection. The association between toxic shock syndrome and COVID-19 is unclear; however, patients should be vigilant for symptoms as toxic shock syndrome can progress rapidly and cause multi-organ failure.",None.,American Journal of Ophthalmology Case Reports,,,2020-12,2020,20,,100843,All OA; Gold,Article,"Feng, Yilin; Armenti, Stephen T.; Albin, Owen R.; Mian, Shahzad I.","Feng, Yilin (University of Michigan, Kellogg Eye Center, Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences. 1000 Wall St, Ann Arbor, MI, 48105, USA); Armenti, Stephen T.

During the subsequent decade, the HPP established collaborations, developed guidelines and metrics, and undertook reanalysis of previously deposited community data, continuously increasing the coverage of the human proteome. On the occasion of the HPP's tenth anniversary, we here report a 90.4% complete high-stringency human proteome blueprint. This knowledge is essential for discerning molecular processes in health and disease, as we demonstrate by highlighting potential roles the human proteome plays in our understanding, diagnosis and treatment of cancers, cardiovascular and infectious diseases.","HUPO acknowledges collaborators, proteomic scientists, independent partners, industry vendors and members of the scientific community who have contributed to the HPP. A full alphabetical listing of the Human Proteome Project members appears in the Supplementary Information.

Knowing the concentration of SARS-CoV-2 S1-specific IgG is crucial in selecting appropriate convalescent serum donors. Here, we present a portable microfluidic ELISA technology for rapid (15 min), quantitative, and sensitive detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 S1 IgG in human serum with only 8 μL sample volume. We first identified a humanized monoclonal IgG that has a high binding affinity and a relatively high specificity towards SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein, which can subsequently serve as the calibration standard of anti-SARS-CoV-2 S1 IgG in serological analyses. We then measured the abundance of anti-SARS-CoV-2 S1 IgG in 16 convalescent COVID-19 patients. Due to the availability of the calibration standard and the large dynamic range of our assay, we were able to identify ""qualified donors"" for convalescent serum therapy with only one fixed dilution factor (200 ×). Finally, we demonstrated that our technology can sensitively detect SARS-CoV-2 antigens (S1 and N proteins) with pg/mL level sensitivities in 40 min. Overall, our technology can greatly facilitate rapid, sensitive, and quantitative analysis of COVID-19 related markers for therapeutic, diagnostic, epidemiologic, and prognostic purposes.","This work was supported by NSF, ECCS-2029484.

Currently numerous drugs are under expedited investigations without well-established safety or efficacy data. Pharmacogenomics may allow individualization of these drugs thereby improving efficacy and safety. In this review, we summarized the pharmacogenomic literature available for COVID-19 drug therapies including hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, azithromycin, remdesivir, favipiravir, ribavirin, lopinavir/ritonavir, darunavir/cobicistat, interferon beta-1b, tocilizumab, ruxolitinib, baricitinib, and corticosteroids. We searched PubMed, reviewed the Pharmacogenomics Knowledgebase (PharmGKB®) website, Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) guidelines, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) pharmacogenomics information in the product labeling, and the FDA pharmacogenomics association table. We found several drug-gene variant pairs that may alter the pharmacokinetics of hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine (CYP2C8, CYP2D6, SLCO1A2, and SLCO1B1); azithromycin (ABCB1); ribavirin (SLC29A1, SLC28A2, and SLC28A3); and lopinavir/ritonavir (SLCO1B1, ABCC2, CYP3A). We also identified other variants, that are associated with adverse effects, most notable in hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine (G6PD; hemolysis), ribavirin (ITPA; hemolysis), and interferon β -1b (IRF6; liver toxicity). We also describe the complexity of the risk for QT prolongation in this setting because of additive effects of combining more than one QT-prolonging drug (i.e., hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine and azithromycin), increased concentrations of the drugs due to genetic variants, along with the risk of also combining therapy with potent inhibitors. In conclusion, although direct evidence in COVID-19 patients is lacking, we identified potential actionable genetic markers in COVID-19 therapies. Clinical studies in COVID-19 patients are deemed warranted to assess potential roles of these markers.","J.A.L. is funded by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute of the NIH (K08 HL146990 and L30 HL110279).

Black people and older adults are the two groups most affected by COVID-19 morbidity and mortality. Double jeopardy, as a race- and age-informed analysis, demonstrates how Black race and older age are associated with practices and policies that shape key life circumstances (e.g., racial residential segregation, family and household composition) and resources in ways that embody elevated risk for COVID-19. The concept of double jeopardy underscores long-standing race- and age-based inequities and social vulnerabilities that produce devastating COVID-19 related deaths and injuries for older Black adults. Developing policies and actions that address race- and age-based inequities and social vulnerabilities can lower risks and enhance protective factors to ensure the health of older Black Americans during the COVID-19 pandemic.",,Health Education & Behavior,,,2020-12,2020,47,6,855-860,All OA; Gold,Article,"Chatters, Linda M.; Taylor, Harry Owen; Taylor, Robert Joseph","Chatters, Linda M.

Understanding the factors affecting the pattern and levels of expression of these genes is important for deeper understanding of SARS-CoV-2 tropism and pathogenesis. Here we explore the role of genetics and co-expression networks in regulating these genes in the airway, through the analysis of nasal airway transcriptome data from 695 children. We identify expression quantitative trait loci for both ACE2 and TMPRSS2, that vary in frequency across world populations. We find TMPRSS2 is part of a mucus secretory network, highly upregulated by type 2 (T2) inflammation through the action of interleukin-13, and that the interferon response to respiratory viruses highly upregulates ACE2 expression. IL-13 and virus infection mediated effects on ACE2 expression were also observed at the protein level in the airway epithelium. Finally, we define airway responses to common coronavirus infections in children, finding that these infections generate host responses similar to other viral species, including upregulation of IL6 and ACE2. Our results reveal possible mechanisms influencing SARS-CoV-2 infectivity and COVID-19 clinical outcomes.","This work was supported by NIH grants (MAS) R01 HL135156, R01 MD010443, R01 HL128439, P01 HL132821, P01 HL107202, R01 HL117004, and DOD Grant W81WH-16-2-0018.

To do this, we formed an international consortium (4CE) of 96 hospitals across five countries (www.covidclinical.net). Contributors utilized the Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside (i2b2) or Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) platforms to map to a common data model. The group focused on temporal changes in key laboratory test values. Harmonized data were analyzed locally and converted to a shared aggregate form for rapid analysis and visualization of regional differences and global commonalities. Data covered 27,584 COVID-19 cases with 187,802 laboratory tests. Case counts and laboratory trajectories were concordant with existing literature. Laboratory tests at the time of diagnosis showed hospital-level differences equivalent to country-level variation across the consortium partners.

Older adults, especially those who are nearing the end of life, are already at higher risk of the detrimental effects of social isolation and loneliness. Novel social distancing rules imposed by governments and agencies during the COVID-19 pandemic have caused older adults to experience a degree of social isolation and loneliness that is unprecedented. This article highlights aspects of the social isolation and loneliness literature. Three cases of elderly patients who required medical care during the COVID-19 pandemic are presented. Common themes of factors contributing to social isolation in each of the health care delivery settings are described, and opportunities for creative interventions by health care providers are identified. As the pandemic continues to unfold and evolve, providers should aim to regularly assess patient risk of isolation and be proactive in preventing negative effects. Additionally, what is learned from health care providers' experiences delivering palliative care during a pandemic can be incorporated into daily practice as social isolation and loneliness are long-standing challenges for the elderly population.",,Journal of Hospice and Palliative Nursing,,"Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Female; Humans; Lymphoma; Male; Palliative Care; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Risk Assessment; Social Isolation; Telemedicine",2020-12,2020,22,6,435-441,Closed,Article,"Harden, Karen; Price, Deborah M; Mason, Heidi; Bigelow, April","Harden, Karen (Karen Harden, DNP, AOCNS, is clinical assistant professor, University of Michigan School of Nursing, Ann Arbor.

The goal of Risk ID is to improve the detection and management of suicide risk by standardizing suicide risk screening and evaluation enterprise-wide. In order to ensure continuous quality improvement (QI), ongoing evaluation and targeted interventions to improve implementation of Risk ID are needed. Moreover, given that facilities will vary with respect to implementation needs and barriers, the dose and type of intervention needed may vary across facilities. Thus, the objective of this study is to examine the effectiveness of an adaptive implementation strategy to improve the uptake of suicide risk screening and evaluation in VHA ambulatory care settings. In addition, this study will examine specific factors that may impact the uptake of suicide risk screening and evaluation and the adoption of different implementation strategies. This protocol describes the stepped implementation approach and proposed evaluation plan. METHODS: Using a sequential multiple assignment randomized trial (SMART) design, two evidence-based implementation strategies will be evaluated: (1) audit and feedback (A&F); (2) A&F plus external facilitation (A&F + EF). Implementation outcomes of interest include uptake of secondary suicide risk screening and uptake of comprehensive suicide risk evaluation (stages 2 and 3 of Risk ID). Secondary outcomes include rates of other clinical outcomes (i.e., safety planning) and organizational factors that may impact Risk ID implementation (i.e., leadership climate and leadership support). DISCUSSION: This national QI study will use a SMART design to evaluate whether an adaptive implementation strategy is effective in improving uptake of a mandated VHA-wide suicide risk screening and evaluation initiative. If this study finds that the proposed stepped implementation strategy is effective at increasing uptake and maintaining performance improvements, this approach may be used as an overarching QI strategy for other national suicide prevention programs.

However, incorrect dosing of these medications is common and puts patients at risk of adverse drug events. One way to improve safe prescribing is the use of population health tools, including interactive dashboards built into the electronic health record (EHR). As such tools become more common, exploring ways to understand which aspects are effective in specific settings and how to effectively adapt and implement in existing anticoagulation clinics across different health systems is vital. METHODS: This three-phase project will evaluate a current nation-wide implementation effort of the DOAC Dashboard in the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) using both quantitative and qualitative methods. Informed by this evaluation, the DOAC Dashboard will be implemented in four new health systems using an implementation strategy derived from the VHA experience and interviews with providers in those new health systems. Quantitative evaluation of the VHA and non-VHA implementation will follow the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework. Qualitative interviews with stakeholders will be analyzed using the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research and Technology Acceptance Models to identify key determinants of implementation success. DISCUSSION: This study will (1) evaluate the implementation of an EHR-based population health tool for medication management within a large, nation-wide, highly integrated health system; (2) guide the adoption in a set of four different health systems; and (3) evaluation that multi-center implementation effort. These findings will help to inform future EHR-based implementation efforts in a wide variety of health care settings.",n/a,Implementation Science,,,2020-12,2020,15,1,83,All OA; Gold,Article,"Barnes, Geoffrey D.; Sippola, Emily; Dorsch, Michael; Errickson, Joshua; Lanham, Michael; Allen, Arthur; Spoutz, Patrick; Sales, Anne E.; Sussman, Jeremy","Barnes, Geoffrey D.

To explore this issue, we study and predict the spread of COVID-19 in Washtenaw County, MI, which is home to University of Michigan and Eastern Michigan University, and in close proximity to Detroit, MI, a major epicenter of the epidemic in Michigan. We apply a discrete and stochastic network-based modeling framework allowing us to track every individual in the county. In this framework, we construct contact networks based on synthetic population datasets specific for Washtenaw County that are derived from US Census datasets. We assign individuals to households, workplaces, schools, and group quarters (such as prisons or long term care facilities). In addition, we assign casual contacts to each individual at random. Using this framework, we explicitly simulate Michigan-specific government-mandated workplace and school closures as well as social distancing measures. We perform sensitivity analyses to identify key model parameters and mechanisms contributing to the observed disease burden in the three months following the first observed cases of COVID-19 in Michigan. We then consider several scenarios for relaxing restrictions and reopening workplaces to predict what actions would be most prudent. In particular, we consider the effects of 1) different timings for reopening, and 2) different levels of workplace vs. casual contact re-engagement. We find that delaying reopening does not reduce the magnitude of the second peak of cases, but only delays it. Reducing levels of casual contact, on the other hand, both delays and lowers the second peak. Through simulations and sensitivity analyses, we explore mechanisms driving the magnitude and timing of a second wave of infections upon re-opening. We find that the most significant factors are workplace and casual contacts and protective measures taken by infected individuals who have sought care. This model can be adapted to other US counties using synthetic population databases and data specific to those regions.","This research was supported by NIH grants R01AI123093 and U01 HL131072 awarded to DEK and NIH grant U01GM110712 and NSF grant DMS 1813210 to MCE.

The traditional clinical trials system acts as a quality funnel for the development and implementation of new drugs, devices and health system interventions. The concept of a ""digital clinical trial"" involves leveraging digital technology to improve participant access, engagement, trial-related measurements, and/or interventions, enable concealed randomized intervention allocation, and has the potential to transform clinical trials and to lower their cost. In April 2019, the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the National Science Foundation (NSF) held a workshop bringing together experts in clinical trials, digital technology, and digital analytics to discuss strategies to implement the use of digital technologies in clinical trials while considering potential challenges. This position paper builds on this workshop to describe the current state of the art for digital clinical trials including (1) defining and outlining the composition and elements of digital trials; (2) describing recruitment and retention using digital technology; (3) outlining data collection elements including mobile health, wearable technologies, application programming interfaces (APIs), digital transmission of data, and consideration of regulatory oversight and guidance for data security, privacy, and remotely provided informed consent; (4) elucidating digital analytics and data science approaches leveraging artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms; and (5) setting future priorities and strategies that should be addressed to successfully harness digital methods and the myriad benefits of such technologies for clinical research.","The workshop that resulted in this work was funded through the National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI), and the National Science Foundation (NSF) under Grant Number 1922762.

Results from a Canadian study,"BACKGROUND: The letter of recommendation is currently an integral part of applicant selection for residency programs. Internal medicine residents will spend much time and expense completing sub-specialty away electives to obtain a letter of recommendation. The purpose of this study was 1) to examine a large sample of reference letters in order to define essential components of a high-quality letter, and 2) to elucidate the relationship between quality of reference letter and the letter writer. METHODS: We conducted a two-phase study. In phase one, a large sample of letters of recommendation was examined using an audit tool as a coding framework. A 5-point composite endpoint of high-quality letter components was subsequently developed. In phase two, program director letters were compared to non-program director home institution and non-home institution elective letters based on inclusion of components of the 5-point composite endpoint using Chi square testing. RESULTS: 715 letters were examined (398 non-program director home institution letters, 201 program director letters, and 116 non-home institution elective letters). High-quality letter components were: nature of relationship, duration of relationship, In Training Evaluation Report information, research involvement and comments on areas for improvement. Program director letters had a significantly higher proportion (10.4%) of all 5 high-quality components, compared to 0% in both non-program director home institution letters and elective letters (p","Logistical support was provided by CaRMS.

Findings from the American Nurses Association Health Risk Appraisal suggested that nurses give the best patient care when they are operating at the peak of their own wellness. They also revealed that 68% of the surveyed nurses place their patients' health, safety, and wellness before their own. Globally, several nursing codes of ethics include the requirement of self-care. Often, these codes embed the responsibility to protect and promote one's own health within the clearly described obligation to provide safe patient care. The American Nurses Association Code of Ethics for Nurses is unique in that it states explicitly that nurses must adopt self-care as a duty to self in addition to their duty to provide care to patients. One of the basic assumptions of Watson's Philosophy and Science of Caring is that caring science is the essence of nursing and the foundational disciplinary core of the profession. Watson's theory of human caring provides support for the engagement in self-care. Two important value assumptions of Watson's Caritas are that ""we have to learn how to offer caring, love, forgiveness, compassion, and mercy to ourselves before we can offer authentic caring and love to others"" and we also must ""treat ourselves with loving-kindness and equanimity, gentleness, and dignity before we can accept, respect, and care for others within a professional caring-healing model."" Embedded within several caritas processes is an outline for a holistic approach to caring for self and others that can guide nurses to improve their mental, physical, emotional, and spiritual health.",,Nursing Ethics,,,2020-12,2020,27,8,1694-1702,Closed,Article,"Linton, Mary; Koonmen, Jamie","Linton, Mary (University of Michigan-Flint, USA); Koonmen, Jamie (University of Michigan-Flint, USA)","Linton, Mary (University of Michigan–Flint)","Linton, Mary (University of Michigan–Flint); Koonmen, Jamie (University of Michigan–Flint)",University of Michigan–Flint,grid.48950.30,United States,,0,0,,,6,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1129695817,2203 Philosophy; 11 Medical and Health Sciences; 1117 Public Health and Health Services; 22 Philosophy and Religious Studies; 1110 Nursing,

The intelligent manufacturing (IM) systems are promising to create a safe working environment by using the automated manufacturing assets which are monitored by the networked sensors and controlled by the intelligent decision-making algorithms. The relief of the production disruption by IM technologies facilitates the reconnection of the good and service flows in the network, which mitigates the severity of industrial chain disruption. In this study, we create a novel intelligent manufacturing framework for the production recovery under the pandemic and build an assessment model to evaluate the impacts of the IM technologies on industrial networks.

DKD is classified on albuminuria and reduced kidney function (estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)) but these have modest value for predicting future renal status. There is an unmet need for biomarkers that can be used in clinical settings which also improve prediction of renal decline on top of routinely available data, particularly in the early stages. The iBEAt study of the BEAt-DKD project aims to determine whether renal imaging biomarkers (magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and ultrasound (US)) provide insight into the pathogenesis and heterogeneity of DKD (primary aim) and whether they have potential as prognostic biomarkers in DKD (secondary aim). METHODS: iBEAt is a prospective multi-centre observational cohort study recruiting 500 patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and eGFR ≥30 ml/min/1.73m2. At baseline, blood and urine will be collected, clinical examinations will be performed, and medical history will be obtained. These assessments will be repeated annually for 3 years. At baseline each participant will also undergo quantitative renal MRI and US with central processing of MRI images. Biological samples will be stored in a central laboratory for biomarker and validation studies, and data in a central data depository. Data analysis will explore the potential associations between imaging biomarkers and renal function, and whether the imaging biomarkers improve the prediction of DKD progression. Ancillary substudies will: (1) validate imaging biomarkers against renal histopathology; (2) validate MRI based renal blood flow measurements against H2O15 positron-emission tomography (PET); (3) validate methods for (semi-)automated processing of renal MRI; (4) examine longitudinal changes in imaging biomarkers; (5) examine whether glycocalyx and microvascular measures are associated with imaging biomarkers and eGFR decline; (6) explore whether the findings in T2D can be extrapolated to type 1 diabetes. DISCUSSION: iBEAt is the largest DKD imaging study to date and will provide valuable insights into the progression and heterogeneity of DKD. The results may contribute to a more personalised approach to DKD management in patients with T2D.

Roughly half of all opioids are prescribed in primary care. Although clinical guidelines describe recommended opioid prescribing practices, implementing these guidelines in a way that balances safety and effectiveness vs. risk remains a challenge. The literature offers little help about which implementation strategies work best in different clinical settings or how strategies could be tailored to optimize their effectiveness in different contexts. Systems consultation consists of (1) educational/engagement meetings with audit and feedback reports, (2) practice facilitation, and (3) prescriber peer consulting. The study is designed to discover the most cost-effective sequence and combination of strategies for improving opioid prescribing practices in diverse primary care clinics. METHODS/DESIGN: The study is a hybrid type 3 clustered, sequential, multiple-assignment randomized trial (SMART) that randomizes clinics from two health systems at two points, months 3 and 9, of a 21-month intervention. Clinics are provided one of four sequences of implementation strategies: a condition consisting of educational/engagement meetings and audit and feedback alone (EM/AF), EM/AF plus practice facilitation (PF), EM/AF + prescriber peer consulting (PPC), and EM/AF + PF + PPC. The study's primary outcome is morphine-milligram equivalent (MME) dose by prescribing clinicians within clinics. The study's primary aim is the comparison of EM/AF + PF + PPC versus EM/AF alone on change in MME from month 3 to month 21. The secondary aim is to derive cost estimates for each of the four sequences and compare them. The exploratory aim is to examine four tailoring variables that can be used to construct an adaptive implementation strategy to meet the needs of different primary care clinics. DISCUSSION: Systems consultation is a practical blend of implementation strategies used in this case to improve opioid prescribing practices in primary care. The blend offers a range of strategies in sequences from minimally to substantially intensive.

We estimate the sensitivity of the network to transient gravitational-wave signals for the third (O3), fourth (O4) and fifth observing (O5) runs, including the planned upgrades of the Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo detectors. We study the capability of the network to determine the sky location of the source for gravitational-wave signals from the inspiral of binary systems of compact objects, that is binary neutron star, neutron star-black hole, and binary black hole systems. The ability to localize the sources is given as a sky-area probability, luminosity distance, and comoving volume. The median sky localization area (90% credible region) is expected to be a few hundreds of square degrees for all types of binary systems during O3 with the Advanced LIGO and Virgo (HLV) network. The median sky localization area will improve to a few tens of square degrees during O4 with the Advanced LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA (HLVK) network. During O3, the median localization volume (90% credible region) is expected to be on the order of  10 5 , 10 6 , 10 7  Mpc 3   for binary neutron star, neutron star-black hole, and binary black hole systems, respectively. The localization volume in O4 is expected to be about a factor two smaller than in O3. We predict a detection count of 1 - 1 + 12   ( 10 - 10 + 52   ) for binary neutron star mergers, of 0 - 0 + 19   ( 1 - 1 + 91   ) for neutron star-black hole mergers, and 17 - 11 + 22   ( 79 - 44 + 89   ) for binary black hole mergers in a one-calendar-year observing run of the HLV network during O3 (HLVK network during O4). We evaluate sensitivity and localization expectations for unmodeled signal searches, including the search for intermediate mass black hole binary mergers.","The authors gratefully acknowledge the support of the United States National Science Foundation (NSF) for the construction and operation of the LIGO Laboratory and Advanced LIGO as well as the Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC) of the United Kingdom, the Max Planck Society (MPS), and the State of Niedersachsen/Germany for support of the construction of Advanced LIGO and construction and operation of the GEO600 detector.

We sought to understand whether these methods could achieve a diverse sample of participants. With more researchers turning to approaches that maintain social distancing in the context of COVID-19, it has become more pressing to refine these remote research methods. METHODS: We used several online sites to recruit for and conduct cognitive testing of survey items. To recruit potential participants we advertised the study on the free online bulletin board, Craigslist, and the free online social network, Reddit. Interested participants completed an online Qualtrics screening form. To maximize diversity, we purposefully selected individuals to invite for participation. We used the video meeting platform, Zoom, to conduct the cognitive interviews. The interviewer opened a document with the items to be tested, shared the screen with the participant, and gave them control of the mouse and keyboard. After the participant self-administered the survey, the interviewer asked about interpretation and comprehension. After completion of the interviews we sent participants a follow-up survey about their impressions of the research methods and technologies used. We describe the processes, the advantages and disadvantages, and offer recommendations for researchers. RESULTS: We recruited and interviewed 30 young people from a range of regions, gender identities, sexual orientations, ages, education, and experiences with sexual activity. These methods allowed us to recruit a purposefully selected diverse sample in terms of race/ethnicity and region. It also may have offered potential participants a feeling of safety and anonymity leading to greater participation from gay, lesbian, and transgender people who would not have agreed to participate in-person. Conducting the interviews using video chat may also have facilitated the inclusion of individuals who would not volunteer for in-person meetings. Disadvantages of video interviewing included participant challenges to finding a private space for the interview and problems with electronic devices. CONCLUSIONS: Online technologies can be used to achieve a diverse sample of research participants, contributing to research findings that better respond to young people's unique identities and situations.","We appreciate support from Project Director, Alice F.

The US has a hybrid healthcare structure; it is a system that does not provide universal coverage, albeit few years ago enacted a mandate (Affordable Care Act-ACA) that provides coverage for the majority of Americans. The US has the highest health expenditure per capita of all western and developed countries; however, most Americans don't tap into the benefits of preventive healthcare. It is estimated that only 8% of Americans undergo routine preventive screenings. On a national level, very few states (15 out of the 50) have above-average preventive healthcare metrics. In literature, many studies focus on the cure of diseases (research areas such as drug discovery and disease prediction); whilst a minority have examined data-driven preventive measures-a matter that Americans and policy makers ought to place at the forefront of national issues. In this work, we present solutions for preventive practices and policies through Machine Learning (ML) methods. ML is morally neutral, it depends on the data that train the models; in this work, we make the case that Big Data is an imperative paradigm for healthcare. We examine disparities in clinical data for US patients by developing correlation and imputation methods for data completeness. Non-conventional patterns are identified. The data lifecycle followed is methodical and deliberate; 1000+ clinical, demographical, and laboratory variables are collected from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Multiple statistical models are deployed (Pearson correlations, Cramer's V, MICE, and ANOVA). Other unsupervised ML models are also examined (K-modes and K-prototypes for clustering). Through the results presented in the paper, pointers to preventive chronic disease tests are presented, and the models are tested and evaluated.",,Journal of Big Data,,,2020-12,2020,7,1,38,All OA; Gold,Article,"Batarseh, Feras A.; Ghassib, Iya; Chong, Deri (Sondor); Su, Po-Hsuan","Batarseh, Feras A.

The objective of this study was to examine the associations between food insecurity, multiple chronic conditions, and self-reported health status among a nationally representative sample of older U.S. adults. Data came from the National Poll on Healthy Aging, a national cross-sectional survey conducted in December 2019 among 2,048 individuals aged 50-80 years. Food insecurity was assessed using the six-item short form of the USDA Food Security Survey Module. The primary outcomes of interest were the number of self-reported chronic conditions and self-reported physical health status. Multinomial logistic regression models were used to examine the associations between food security status and the outcomes of interest, adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics. The overall prevalence of food insecurity among older adults was 14%. After adjustment for sociodemographic characteristics, food insecurity was positively associated with multiple chronic conditions (RRR 1.60, 95% CI 1.08, 2.36, for 2-3 conditions vs. 0-1; RRR 2.59, 95% CI 1.55, 4.33 for 4-10 chronic conditions vs. 0-1). Food insecurity was also associated with lower self-reported health status (RRR 1.84, 95% CI 1.16, 2.93 for good vs. excellent/ very good health; RRR 5.13, 95% CI 3.08, 8.52 for fair/poor vs. excellent/very good health). Food insecurity is an important social determinant of health among older adults. These findings can contribute to clinical and public health efforts to simultaneously alleviate food insecurity and promote health behaviors among older adults.","Acknowledgments: Funding for the National Poll on Healthy Aging was provided by the University of Michigan Institute for Healthcare Policy and Innovation and the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP).

However, in small and medium-sized animal models, anesthesia is often required for these procedures and can be a research confounder. This study compared the effects of select survival agents (dexmedetomidine, alfaxalone, and propofol) on urodynamic (Δpressure, bladder capacity, bladder compliance, non-voiding contractions, bladder pressure slopes) and anesthetic (change in heart rate [∆HR], average heart rate [HR], reflexes, induction/recovery times) parameters in repeated cystometrograms across five adult male cats. The urodynamic parameters under isoflurane and α-chloralose were also examined in terminal procedures for four cats. Δpressure was greatest with propofol, bladder capacity was highest with α-chloralose, non-voiding contractions were greatest with α-chloralose. Propofol and dexmedetomidine had the highest bladder pressure slopes during the initial and final portions of the cystometrograms respectively. Cats progressed to a deeper plane of anesthesia (lower HR, smaller ΔHR, decreased reflexes) under dexmedetomidine, compared to propofol and alfaxalone. Time to induction was shortest with propofol, and time to recovery was shortest with dexmedetomidine. These agent-specific differences in urodynamic and anesthetic parameters in cats will facilitate appropriate study-specific anesthetic choices.","We thank Zachariah Sperry, Ahmad Jiman, Elizabeth Bottorff, Hannah Parrish, and other members of the Peripheral Neural Engineering and Urodynamics (pNEURO) Lab for their assistance with surgeries, data collection, and analysis.

Objective: To characterize the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on state OOHCA rates.   Methods: Data for non-traumatic, OOHCA were obtained and analyzed from a statewide EMS information system from March 1, 2000 to May 31, 2020 (pandemic) and compared to data obtained from the same 3-month period the prior year (control). Analysis occurred using a web-based application designed to analyze state EMS data. OOHCA were identified using a validated data filter applied to 911 calls and limited to transporting EMS units. Shockable OOHCA and arrests occurring in 5 counties with the highest number of COVID-19 deaths during the pandemic were also analyzed.   Results: There were 4,665 OOHCAs identified during the pandemic compared to 3,261 OOHCA during the control period, a 43.1% increase (p<0.00001). Bystander AED use (10% vs 10%), bystander CPR (38% vs. 38%), and bystander witnessed arrests (34% and 33%) were similar. Rates of EMS termination of resuscitation (TOR) were higher (59% vs. 47%), while endotracheal intubation (ETI) (12% vs. 31%), and ROSC (5% vs. 8%) were lower during the COVID-19 period. Blacks had a higher rate of OOHCA during the pandemic period (26.6% vs 18.6%, p<0.00001). Overall shockable OOHCA increased by 14.8% (403 vs. 351, p=0.002) during the pandemic. Bystander AED use (10% vs 11%), bystander CPR (55% vs. 51%), and bystander witnessed (71% and 71%) were similar. Rates of field TOR were 33% vs. 24%, ETI were 14% vs. 31%, and ROSC were 16% vs. 17%. Within the 5 highest impact counties total OOHCA increased by 61.4% (2,702 vs. 1,674, p<0.00001) and shockable OOHCAs increased by 21.4% (207 vs 170, p=0.004).   Conclusions: OOHCA and shockable OOHCA increased during the COVID-19 pandemic statewide and to a higher degree in the 5 high impact counties. Little change was noted in rates of bystander AED use, CPR, and witnessed arrests. EMS TOR rates increased while ETI rates decreased. ROSC rates decreased in the overall OOHCA group but were not significantly changed in shockable OOHCA. OOHCA involving the black race occurred more frequently.

It remains unclear whether cardiac arrest (CA) resuscitation generates aerosols that have the potential to transmit diseases including COVID-19.   Hypothesis: In a swine CA model, chest compression and defibrillation generate aerosols (≤10 μm) that could contain respiratory viruses.   Methods: To simulate witnessed CA with bystander-initiated CPR, 3 female non-intubated swine underwent 4 minutes of untreated ventricular fibrillation CA followed by ten 2-minute cycles of mechanical chest compression and defibrillation without ventilation. The diameter (0.3 - 10 μm) and quantity of aerosols generated during 45-second intervals of no-flow, chest compression, and after each defibrillation were collected via a nose cone by the TSI Optical Particle Sizer. Aerosol generated from the coughs of 4 healthy human subjects were also compared to the swine data.   Results: There was no significant difference between the total aerosols generated during chest compression compared to no-flow. In contrast, defibrillation followed by chest compression generated significantly more aerosols than chest compression or no-flow alone (72.4 ± 41.6 x10 4 vs 12.3 ± 8.3 x10 4 vs 10.5 ± 11.2 x10 4 ; p < 0.0001), particularly at the larger-sized aerosols. Two consecutive human coughs generated 54.7 ± 33.9 x10 4 aerosols with a size distribution much smaller than post-defibrillation CPR (Table).   Conclusion: Chest compression generated comparable aerosols to no-flow in a swine CA model. In contrast, defibrillation followed by chest compression generated significantly more aerosols than chest compression or no-flow alone, with a distribution shift toward larger aerosols. Additional research is needed to elucidate the mechanisms by which aerosol generation during chest compression is modified by defibrillation and to assess rescuer risk during CA resuscitation.",,Circulation,,,2020-11-17,2020,142,Suppl_4,,Closed,Article,"Hsu, Cindy H; Tiba, Mohamad H; Boehman, Andre; McCracken, Brendan M; Leander, Danielle C; Francalancia, Stephanie C; Pickell, Zachary; Sanderson, Thomas H; Ward, Kevin R; Neumar, Robert W","Hsu, Cindy H (Univ of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI); Tiba, Mohamad H (Univ of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI); Boehman, Andre (Univ of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI); McCracken, Brendan M (Univ of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI); Leander, Danielle C (Univ of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI); Francalancia, Stephanie C (Univ of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI); Pickell, Zachary (Univ of Michigan, Imlay City, MI); Sanderson, Thomas H (Univ of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI); Ward, Kevin R (Univ of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI); Neumar, Robert W (Univ of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI)",,"Hsu, Cindy H (University of Michigan); Tiba, Mohamad H (University of Michigan); Boehman, Andre (University of Michigan); McCracken, Brendan M (University of Michigan); Leander, Danielle C (University of Michigan); Francalancia, Stephanie C (University of Michigan); Pickell, Zachary (University of Michigan); Sanderson, Thomas H (University of Michigan); Ward, Kevin R (University of Michigan); Neumar, Robert W (University of Michigan)",University of Michigan,grid.214458.e,United States,,0,0,,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1132482682,1102 Cardiorespiratory Medicine and Haematology; 11 Medical and Health Sciences,

Determining which patients should be prioritized is inherently subjective and difficult to assess. The authors have proposed an algorithm to fairly and consistently triage patients and mitigate the risk of adverse outcomes. METHODS: Two separate expert panels, a consensus panel (11 participants) and a validation panel (15 participants), were constructed among international HNC surgeons. Using a modified Delphi process and RAND Corporation/University of California at Los Angeles methodology with 4 consensus rounds and 2 meetings, groupings of high-priority, intermediate-priority, and low-priority indications for surgery were established and subdivided. A point-based scoring algorithm was developed, the Surgical Prioritization and Ranking Tool and Navigation Aid for Head and Neck Cancer (SPARTAN-HN). Agreement was measured during consensus and for algorithm scoring using the Krippendorff alpha. Rankings from the algorithm were compared with expert rankings of 12 case vignettes using the Spearman rank correlation coefficient. RESULTS: A total of 62 indications for surgical priority were rated. Weights for each indication ranged from -4 to +4 (scale range; -17 to 20). The response rate for the validation exercise was 100%. The SPARTAN-HN demonstrated excellent agreement and correlation with expert rankings (Krippendorff alpha, .91 [95% CI, 0.88-0.93]; and rho, 0.81 [95% CI, 0.45-0.95]). CONCLUSIONS: The SPARTAN-HN surgical prioritization algorithm consistently stratifies patients requiring HNC surgical care in the COVID-19 era. Formal evaluation and implementation are required. LAY SUMMARY: Many countries have enacted strict rules regarding the use of hospital resources during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Facing delays in surgery, patients may experience worse functional outcomes, stage migration, and eventual inoperability. Treatment prioritization tools have shown benefit in helping to triage patients equitably with minimal provider cognitive burden. The current study sought to develop what to the authors' knowledge is the first cancer-specific surgical prioritization tool for use in the COVID-19 era, the Surgical Prioritization and Ranking Tool and Navigation Aid for Head and Neck Cancer (SPARTAN-HN). This algorithm consistently stratifies patients requiring head and neck cancer surgery in the COVID-19 era and provides evidence for the initial uptake of the SPARTAN-HN.",,Cancer,,"Algorithms; Betacoronavirus; Clinical Decision-Making; Consensus; Coronavirus Infections; Head and Neck Neoplasms; Health Resources; Humans; International Cooperation; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Reproducibility of Results; Research Design; Surgeons; Triage",2020-11-15,2020,126,22,4895-4904,All OA; Gold,Article,"Almeida, John R.; Noel, Christopher W.; Forner, David; Zhang, Han; Nichols, Anthony C.; Cohen, Marc A.; Wong, Richard J.; McMullen, Caitlin; Graboyes, Evan M.; Divi, Vasu; Shuman, Andrew G.; Rosko, Andrew J.; Lewis, Carol M.; Hanna, Ehab Y.; Myers, Jeffrey; Paleri, Vinidh; Miles, Brett; Genden, Eric; Eskander, Antoine; Enepekides, Danny J.; Higgins, Kevin M.; Brown, Dale; Chepeha, Douglas B.; Witterick, Ian J.; Gullane, Patrick J.; Irish, Jonathan C.; Monteiro, Eric; Goldstein, David P.; Gilbert, Ralph","Almeida, John R.

Despite this, there is a lack of a systematic overarching understanding of personality in health care human robot interaction (H-HRI). To address this, the authors conducted a review that identified 18 studies on personality in H-HRI. This paper presents the results of that systematic literature review. Insights are derived from this review regarding the methodologies, outcomes, and samples utilized. The authors of this review discuss findings across this literature while identifying several gaps worthy of attention. Overall, this paper is an important starting point in understanding personality in H-HRI.",,,Proceedings of the 8th International Conference on Human-Agent Interaction,,2020-11-10,2020,,,87-95,Closed,Proceeding,"Esterwood, Connor; Robert, Lionel P.","Esterwood, Connor (University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA); Robert, Lionel P.

Objective: To determine whether hydroxychloroquine is an efficacious treatment for adults hospitalized with COVID-19. Design, Setting, and Participants: This was a multicenter, blinded, placebo-controlled randomized trial conducted at 34 hospitals in the US. Adults hospitalized with respiratory symptoms from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection were enrolled between April 2 and June 19, 2020, with the last outcome assessment on July 17, 2020. The planned sample size was 510 patients, with interim analyses planned after every 102 patients were enrolled. The trial was stopped at the fourth interim analysis for futility with a sample size of 479 patients. Interventions: Patients were randomly assigned to hydroxychloroquine (400 mg twice daily for 2 doses, then 200 mg twice daily for 8 doses) (n = 242) or placebo (n = 237). Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was clinical status 14 days after randomization as assessed with a 7-category ordinal scale ranging from 1 (death) to 7 (discharged from the hospital and able to perform normal activities). The primary outcome was analyzed with a multivariable proportional odds model, with an adjusted odds ratio (aOR) greater than 1.0 indicating more favorable outcomes with hydroxychloroquine than placebo. The trial included 12 secondary outcomes, including 28-day mortality. Results: Among 479 patients who were randomized (median age, 57 years; 44.3% female; 37.2% Hispanic/Latinx; 23.4% Black; 20.1% in the intensive care unit; 46.8% receiving supplemental oxygen without positive pressure; 11.5% receiving noninvasive ventilation or nasal high-flow oxygen; and 6.7% receiving invasive mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation), 433 (90.4%) completed the primary outcome assessment at 14 days and the remainder had clinical status imputed. The median duration of symptoms prior to randomization was 5 days (interquartile range [IQR], 3 to 7 days). Clinical status on the ordinal outcome scale at 14 days did not significantly differ between the hydroxychloroquine and placebo groups (median [IQR] score, 6 [4-7] vs 6 [4-7]; aOR, 1.02 [95% CI, 0.73 to 1.42]). None of the 12 secondary outcomes were significantly different between groups. At 28 days after randomization, 25 of 241 patients (10.4%) in the hydroxychloroquine group and 25 of 236 (10.6%) in the placebo group had died (absolute difference, -0.2% [95% CI, -5.7% to 5.3%]; aOR, 1.07 [95% CI, 0.54 to 2.09]). Conclusions and Relevance: Among adults hospitalized with respiratory illness from COVID-19, treatment with hydroxychloroquine, compared with placebo, did not significantly improve clinical status at day 14. These findings do not support the use of hydroxychloroquine for treatment of COVID-19 among hospitalized adults.

The most recent global burden of disease studies highlight that severe periodontitis is one of the most prevalent chronic inflammatory conditions affecting humans. Periodontitis risk is attributed to genetics, host-microbiome and environmental factors. Empirical diagnostic and prognostic systems have yet to be validated in the field of periodontics. Early diagnosis and intervention prevents periodontitis progression in most patients. Increased susceptibility and suboptimal control of modifiable risk factors can result in poor response to therapy, and relapse. The chronic immune-inflammatory response to microbial biofilms at the tooth or dental implant surface is associated with systemic conditions such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes or gastrointestinal diseases. Oral fluid-based biomarkers have demonstrated easy accessibility and potential as diagnostics for oral and systemic diseases, including the identification of SARS-CoV-2 in saliva. Advances in biotechnology have led to innovations in lab-on-a-chip and biosensors to interface with oral-based biomarker assessment. This review highlights new developments in oral biomarker discovery and their validation for clinical application to advance precision oral medicine through improved diagnosis, prognosis and patient stratification. Their potential to improve clinical outcomes of periodontitis and associated chronic conditions will benefit the dental and overall public health.",This authors thank James Sugai for critically reading the manuscript.

There are four identified factors that puts one at high-risk for infection and/or mortality creating a disparity: age, comorbidities, race/ethnicity, and gender. Data indicate that the older a person is, and/or the presence of obesity and diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and chronic kidney disease place one at higher risk for COVID-19. In the United States, specific race/ethnicities, particularly African Americans and Native Americans, are strong COVID-19 risk components. Male gender has also emerged as a severity risk factor. For age and racial/ethnicities, the accumulation of health comorbidities are common precipitating mechanisms. In particular, underlying socioeconomic structures in the United States likely drive development of comorbidities, putting affected populations at higher risk for severe COVID-19. Sudden cardiac death triggered by a common sodium channel variant in African Americans with COVID-19 has not been evaluated as a cause for racial disparity. There is no evidence that racial/ethnic differences for COVID-19 are caused by ABO blood groups, use of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, or from amino acid substitutions in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. There is growing evidence that androgen-enabled expression of ACE2 receptors and the serine protease TMPRSS2, two permissive elements engaging the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein for infection, may contribute to severe COVID-19 in men. Overall, COVID-19 has generated disparities for who is infected and the severity of that infection.

Although isolated from others, people can still receive support from others, which might lower their COVID-19 anxiety. To examine the relationship between loneliness, perceived social support, and anxiety, we measured 222 Chinese participants’ (54.50% female, Mage = 31.53, SD = 8.17) trait loneliness, chronic anxiety before the outbreak, COVID-19 anxiety at the peak and decline stages of COVID-19, and their perceived social support across the three time points. The results showed that people’s perceived social support dramatically increased from the pre-pandemic to the peak COVID-19 stage, and remained stable during the decline of COVID-19 stage. In contrast, COVID-19 anxiety decreased from the peak to the decline stage. Further, perceived social support consistently moderated the relationship between loneliness with both chronic anxiety and COVID-19 anxiety. The current study provides initial evidence that perceived social support provides protection for lonely people in daily life as well as during unexpected disasters, which will contribute to finding ways to alleviate lonely people’s anxiety during this global health crisis.","We thank the staff of this project for their unending contributions to this work, which made this research possible.",Frontiers in Psychology,,,2020-11-06,2020,11,,566965,All OA; Gold,Article,"Xu, Jianjie; Ou, Jingyi; Luo, Shuyi; Wang, Zhuojun; Chang, Edward; Novak, Claire; Shen, Jingyi; Zheng, Shaoying; Wang, Yinan","Xu, Jianjie (Faculty of Psychology, Beijing Normal University, Beijing, China); Ou, Jingyi (Faculty of Psychology, Beijing Normal University, Beijing, China); Luo, Shuyi (Faculty of Psychology, Beijing Normal University, Beijing, China); Wang, Zhuojun (Faculty of Psychology, Beijing Normal University, Beijing, China); Chang, Edward (Department of Psychology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, United States); Novak, Claire (Department of Psychology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, United States); Shen, Jingyi (Faculty of Psychology, Beijing Normal University, Beijing, China); Zheng, Shaoying (Faculty of Psychology, Beijing Normal University, Beijing, China); Wang, Yinan (Faculty of Psychology, Beijing Normal University, Beijing, China; Beijing Key Laboratory of Applied Experimental Psychology, Faculty of Psychology, National Demonstration Center for Experimental Psychology Education, Beijing Normal University, Beijing, China)","Wang, Yinan (Beijing Normal University; Beijing Normal University)","Xu, Jianjie (Beijing Normal University); Ou, Jingyi (Beijing Normal University); Luo, Shuyi (Beijing Normal University); Wang, Zhuojun (Beijing Normal University); Chang, Edward (University of Michigan); Novak, Claire (University of Michigan); Shen, Jingyi (Beijing Normal University); Zheng, Shaoying (Beijing Normal University); Wang, Yinan (Beijing Normal University; Beijing Normal University)",University of Michigan; Beijing Normal University,grid.214458.e; grid.20513.35,United States; China,National Natural Science Foundation of China,0,0,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.566965,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1132360649,1702 Cognitive Sciences; 17 Psychology and Cognitive Sciences; 1701 Psychology,

IPV is associated with an increased risk of homicide, with firearms as the most commonly used weapon. We designed this study to better understand the correlation of interpersonal trauma exposures and demographic factors on firearm perceptions among a cohort of IPV-exposed women. Methods: 267 women in central Pennsylvania with exposure to IPV were surveyed about perceptions of gun access, safety, and gun presence in the home. Trauma variables included IPV type, IPV recency, unwanted sexual exposure, and adverse childhood experiences (ACEs). Multivariable analyses examined three questions examining firearm perceptions controlling for trauma exposures and demographics. Results: Ease of firearm acquisition: Women who were older (mean 44.92 years +/- SD 12.05), compared to women who were younger (40.91 +/- SD 11.81 years) were more likely to describe it as easy or very easy to acquire a gun (aOR 1.05, 95%CI 1.004, 1.10). Perceived safety in the proximity of a gun: Women with the highest ACE score were less likely to feel safe with a gun nearby (aOR 0.31, 95%CI 0.14,0.67). Odds of guns in the home: Women who were divorced or separated (aOR 0.22, 95%CI 0.09,0.54), women were widowed or single (aOR0.23, 95%CI 0.08,0.67), and women who were partnered (aOR 0.45 95%CI 0.20, 0.97) had lower odds of having a gun in the home, compared to married women. There was no significant effect of the trauma variables on the odds of having a gun at home.

Elevated levels of blood neutrophils and neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) have recently been described in patients with COVID-19. However, their potential role in COVID-19-associated thrombosis remains incompletely understood. In order to elucidate the potential role of hyperactive neutrophils and NET release in COVID-19-associated thrombosis, we conducted a case-control study of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 who developed thrombosis, as compared with gender- and age-matched COVID-19 patients without clinical thrombosis. We found that remnants of NETs (cell-free DNA, myeloperoxidase-DNA complexes, and citrullinated histone H3) and neutrophil-derived S100A8/A9 (calprotectin) in patient sera were associated with higher risk of morbid thrombotic events in spite of prophylactic anticoagulation. These observations underscore the need for urgent investigation into the potential relationship between NETs and unrelenting thrombosis in COVID-19, as well as novel approaches for thrombosis prevention.","The work was supported by a COVID-19 Cardiovascular Impact Research Ignitor Grant from the Michigan Medicine Frankel Cardiovascular Center as well as by the A.

There is currently no proven effective therapy for SARS-CoV-2 infection beyond supportive care. Convalescent plasma (CP), collected from individuals who have recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection, has been safely used to transfer virus-neutralizing antibodies to patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Herein we report on the clinical course and outcomes of patients who received CP for the treatment of COVID-19 across our health system. Methods: Hospitalized patients ≥ 18 years of age at 5 hospitals in the Yale-New Haven Health System with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe or life-threatening disease (Figure 1) were enrolled in the US COVID-19 Expanded Access Program (EAP) and transfused 1 unit of CP. Patient outcomes were assessed at 7, 14, and 28 days after CP transfusion. Furthermore, we sought to determine mortality predictors in this patient cohort. Results: 105 patients enrolled in the EAP were transfused CP from 4/12/2020 to 6/14/2020. Median age was 62 years (28-88 years). 62.9% of patients were male. Individuals of a non-white race comprised 56.2% of our cohort and 33.3% identified as Hispanic or Latinx. 47.6% of patients had a body mass index greater than 30, with 13.3% classified as extremely obese. Diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia were highly prevalent in our population. Concomitant therapy for COVID-19 included hydroxychloroquine (79.0%), tocilizumab (79.0%), and remdesivir (23.8%) (Table 1). 91 patients required the intensive care unit (ICU) during their hospital course, with 87 patients in the ICU at the time of CP transfusion. 42.9% of patients had an improvement in their World Health Organization (WHO) Ordinal Scale score by day 7 post-CP transfusion (median 4 days to improvement), while 9.5% demonstrated an increase in their WHO score indicating worsening oxygenation during the 7 days following CP (Figure 2). Mortality was 10.48% at 7 days, 20.95% at 14 days, and 28.57% at 28 days post-CP transfusion (Figure 2). Of the patients in the ICU at the time of CP, 56 (64.4%) de-escalated to non-ICU care after a median of 8 days from transfusion and 55 (63.2%) were ultimately discharged from the hospital. The median time from CP transfusion to discharge in survivors was 14 days (2-103 days), while median time from CP to death in non-survivors was 10 days (1-76 days). The mean time in days both from hospital admission to CP and from positive SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to CP trended slightly longer in non-survivors when compared to survivors (8.6 vs 6.9 days, p=0.218 and 9.7 vs 7.3 days, p=0.85, respectively). D-dimer levels >5 milligrams per liter fibrinogen equivalent units (mg/L FEU) were associated with increased mortality at 24 (OR 2.79, 95% CI 1.18-6.72), 48 (OR 3.64, 95% CI 1.44-9.70), and 72 hours (OR 2.99, 95% CI 1.23-7.66) post-CP transfusion (Figure 3). Twelve patients (11.4%) on prophylactic or intermediate dose anticoagulation were subsequently escalated to therapeutic dosing during the 7 days after CP transfusion. Furthermore, a ferritin level of >3000 nanograms per milliliter (ng/mL) on the day of CP was associated with increased mortality (OR 5.14, 95% CI 1.34-19.68). Conclusions: CP therapy was administered through the EAP to COVID-19 patients with severe disease and with advanced age, high frequency of obesity, and extensive co-morbidity. In this COVID-19 population with high expected mortality, 42.9% of patients improved by WHO Ordinal Scale score within 7 days of CP transfusion and 52.4% were alive and discharged at 28 days. Baseline ferritin and d-dimer levels at 24, 48, and 72 hours post-CP were predictors of mortality, the latter raising the possibility that the increased thrombotic risk associated with COVID-19 may be exacerbated by administration of blood products from donors potentially in a residual procoagulant state. Further studies by our group are underway to assess hemostatic balance in donor CP, to estimate associations with outcomes by comparing patients who received CP with a matched control cohort of COVID-19 patients who did not receive CP, and to evaluate efficacy of CP in a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial.   Disclosures McLeod: Gilead Pharmaceuticals: Other: Medical Advisor .   OffLabel Disclosure: We have described in this abstract patients across our health system who received investigational convalescent plasma therapy through enrollment in the ""Expanded Access to Convalescent Plasma for the Treatment of Patients with COVID-19"" protocol that is funded by BARDA and run by the Mayo Clinic, where primary IRB protocol is held. Previous guidance issued by the FDA regarding investigational use of COVID-19 convalescent plasma included recommendations for the expanded access program as a method by which to facilitate access to this blood product across the nation. Safety data reported thus far from the expanded access program has demonstrated no concerning findings, with a very low rate of serious adverse events. Therefore given the overall tolerability of convalescent plasma and the lack of other proven therapies for COVID-19, we believe it is important to report these findings even in the absence of current approval for convalescent plasma transfusion in the management of COVID-19.",,Blood,,,2020-11-05,2020,136,Supplement 1,39-40,Closed,Article,"Browning, Sabrina L.; Gormally, Michael; Briggs, Neima; Li, Muyi; Zakko, Alan; Laurent-Rolle, Maudry; Ladines-Lim, Joseph; Morrison, Alyssa; Kandel, Prakash; Khan, Mohammad; McLeod, Gavin X.; Buller, Gregory K.; Owusu, Kent A.; Treggiari, Miriam M.; Hendrickson, Jeanne E.; Tormey, Christopher A.; Desruisseaux, Mahalia S.","Browning, Sabrina L.

The initial stage of infection occurs at the time of respiratory viral invasion through angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors in alveolar pneumocytes and macrophages. In the second stage of established pulmonary disease without and with hypoxia, viral multiplication and localized inflammation occurs. The third stage COVID-19 is the most severe, characterized by systemic hyperinflammation, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and generalized microangiopathy, with significantly elevated biomarkers including IL-2, IL-6, IL-7, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor, macrophage inflammatory protein 1α, tumor necrosis factor-α, C-reactive protein, ferritin, D-dimer, von Willebrand factor (vWF) and thrombomodulin (TM). Evidence suggests that endothelial damage and activation play a key role in the pathobiology of the disease, and thus protecting endothelium and reversing endotheliitis may be a key therapeutic goal (Teuwen et al,Nat Rev Immunol2020). Defibrotide (DF), a complex mixture of poly-deoxyribonucleotides extracted from porcine mucosa, modulates expression of thrombogenic and inflammatory mediators produced in response to endothelial cell injury and/or leukocyte activation. DF increases tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) and TM expression, thereby enhancing the enzymatic activity of plasmin to hydrolyze fibrin clot, while also decreasing vWF and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1). Platelet adhesion is inhibited via increases in nitric oxide (NO), prostaglandin I2 (PGI2), and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) (Falanga A et al,Leukemia 2003). Anti-inflammatory properties via inhibition of p38 MAPK pathway have been demonstrated with DF, attenuating the release of inflammatory mediators including IL-6, thromboxane A2, leukotriene B4, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and reactive oxygen species (Mitsiades et al,Clin Cancer Res2009). Additionally, DF inhibits both the expression and activity of heparanase, which in turn modulates heparan sulfate, a vital moiety for viral infection (Richardson et al,Blood Adv2018; Koganti et al,Cell Mol Life Sci2020). DF also modulates endothelial cell injury in murine models by down-regulating the expression of endothelial cell adhesion molecules such as E-selectin, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), that are critical to leukocyte adhesion and migration, and by increasing the endothelial cell release of anti-inflammatory cytokines, conferring survival benefit (Garcia-Bernal et al,J Cell Mol Med2020). DF is approved for the treatment of severe veno-occlusive disease/sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (VOD/SOS) complicating stem cell transplantation and has demonstrated efficacy and safety in critically ill patients with multi-organ failure, underpinned by vasculopathy, endotheliitis, immune activation and hemorrhagic risk (Richardson et al,Blood2016). This multi-target and pleiotropic approach makes DF an attractive candidate for the treatment of advanced stage COVID 19 and the systemic endothelial complications underpinning both its pathobiology and ensuing mortality (Figure 1). Various clinical studies in Spain, Italy, Ireland, the UK and USA are underway, with the larger randomized placebo-controlled prospective phase 2 study in Spain (clinicaltrials.gov: NCT04348383) leading in accrual with promising early results, demonstrating safety to date with potential efficacy, as reflected by favorable outcome in a subset of intubated patients as part of an ongoing multi-center trial. Other studies within the group have focused on safety and particularly the therapeutic role of DF in advanced disease, including those patients requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and full dose systemic anticoagulation. These trials include common in-depth biological correlatives, assessing biomarkers including heparanase, inflammatory cytokines, immune cell sub-populations, vWF and soluble TM, as well as other novel markers and pharmacokinetics. In aggregate, these studies will hopefully help demonstrate the effects of DF on the proposed targets in COVID-19 and successfully correlate these effects with improved clinical outcome.

We report the incidence of and risk factors for VTE and PE among hospitalized patients with cancer and COVID-19. Methods: The COVID-19 and Cancer Consortium (CCC19) developed an international retrospective cohort study (NCT04354701) to investigate the clinical course and complications of COVID-19 among adult patients with an active or previous history of cancer. For the current study, cumulative incidences of clinically detected VTE and PE were analyzed among hospitalized patients with laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2. Pre-specified subgroup analysis was performed to examine the interaction between intensive care unit (ICU) admission and recent anti-cancer therapy on VTE outcomes. Bivariable logistic regression analyses were conducted to assess the association between baseline variables and VTE; unadjusted odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were reported. These variables included age, sex, obesity (BMI>30), race/ethnicity, performance status, comorbidities, blood type, history of VTE, recent surgery, recent anti-cancer therapy, cancer subtype VTE risk grouping (adapted from Khorana Score), pre-admission anticoagulant or antiplatelet use, and ICU admission status. Results: From March 17, 2020 to July 31, 2020, 3914 patients were enrolled in the CCC19 registry. For the present analysis, patients were excluded if they had inadequate follow-up <4 weeks (n=950), were not admitted to the hospital (n=1008), or had unknown VTE outcomes (n=327). Among the 1629 hospitalized patients, the median follow-up was 35 days. Patients were comprised from 3 countries (92% US, 6% Canada, 2% Spain), with a median age of 70, 45% female, and a median comorbidity score of 3. Racial/ethnic breakdown included 44% White, 26% Black, 14% Hispanic, and 13% Other. A past history of VTE was reported in 9% of patients; pre-admission anticoagulant use and antiplatelet use were reported in 25% and 35% of patients, respectively. The most common cancer types included prostate (18%), breast (15%), and lymphoma (14%). Based on the VTE risk grouping adapted from the original Khorana Score, 34% were low-risk, 29% were high-risk, and 6% were very high-risk. The receipt of anti-cancer therapy within 3 months of diagnosis was observed in 39% of patients (17% cytotoxic chemotherapy, 11% targeted therapy, 7% endocrine therapy, and 5% immunotherapy). The overall incidence of inhospital VTE and PE was 9.3% and 5.2%, respectively. The corresponding estimates were 13.4% and 7.9% among the ICU subgroup. On bivariable analysis, significant predictors of VTE included ICU admission, recent anti-cancer therapy, active cancer status, cancer subtype VTE risk grouping, and pre-admission antiplatelet use (Table 1). Pre-admission anticoagulant use had significant associations with PE but not VTE. Multivariable adjustment is ongoing to identify independent risk factor for VTE and clarify the impact of pre-admission anticoagulant/antiplatelet use controlled for other potential confounders. Both ICU admission status and anti-cancer therapy increased the risk of VTE independently. Non-ICU patients not on anti-cancer therapy had the lowest incidence of VTE (4.5%), whose estimate was similar to that reported in the non-cancer hospitalized population with COVID-19 infection. Patients with either ICU admission or recent anti-cancer therapy had the intermediate risk (11.0%), whereas ICU patients with recent anti-cancer therapy had the highest risk (16.7%). We did not observe confounding or effect modification by the ICU subgroup on the association between anti-cancer therapy and VTE. Conclusion: In this cohort study of hospitalized patients with cancer and COVID-19, recent anti-cancer therapy, active disease, high-risk VTE cancer subtypes, and ICU admission have increased risk of VTE and PE, while pre-admission anticoagulant/antiplatelet therapy may reduce the risk. This information will aid in developing a risk prediction tool for VTE in hospitalized patients with cancer and COVID-19.

We conducted a secondary analysis of a cross-sectional, nationally representative survey of Internet users to evaluate whether there were racial/ethnic disparities in self-reported telehealth use early in the pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Pew Research Center fielded the survey March 19-24, 2020. Telehealth use because of the pandemic was measured by asking whether respondents (N = 10,624) ""used the internet or email to connect with doctors or other medical professionals as a result of the coronavirus outbreak."" We conducted survey-weighted logistic regressions, adjusting for respondents' socioeconomic characteristics and perceived threat of the pandemic to their own health (no threat, minor, major). RESULTS: Approximately 17% of respondents reported using telehealth because of the pandemic, with significantly higher unadjusted odds among Blacks, Latinos, and those identified with other race compared to White respondents. The multivariable logistic regressions and sensitivity analyses show Black respondents were more likely than Whites to report using telehealth because of the pandemic, particularly when perceiving the pandemic as a minor threat to their own health. DISCUSSION: Black respondents are most likely to report using telehealth because of the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly when they perceive the pandemic as a minor health threat. CONCLUSION: The systemic racism creating health and health care disparities has likely raised the need for telehealth among Black patients during the pandemic. Findings suggest opportunities to leverage a broadly defined set of telehealth tools to reduce health care disparities post-pandemic.",,Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association,,,2020-11-04,2020,,,ocaa221-,All OA; Gold,Article,"Campos-Castillo, Celeste; Anthony, Denise","Campos-Castillo, Celeste (University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee); Anthony, Denise (University of Michigan)",,"Campos-Castillo, Celeste (University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee); Anthony, Denise (University of Michigan)",University of Michigan; University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee,grid.214458.e; grid.267468.9,United States; United States,,0,0,,,34,https://academic.oup.com/jamia/advance-article-pdf/doi/10.1093/jamia/ocaa221/33723072/ocaa221.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1130436630,1117 Public Health and Health Services; 11 Medical and Health Sciences,

Decisions on if, when, and how to perform tracheostomy in patients with COVID-19 have major implications for patients, clinicians, and hospitals. We investigated the tracheostomy protocols and practices that institutions around the world have put into place in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. DATA SOURCES: Protocols for tracheostomy in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection from individual institutions (n = 59) were obtained from the United States and 25 other countries, including data from several low- and middle-income countries, 23 published or society-endorsed protocols, and 36 institutional protocols. REVIEW METHODS: The comparative document analysis involved cross-sectional review of institutional protocols and practices. Data sources were analyzed for timing of tracheostomy, contraindications, preoperative testing, personal protective equipment (PPE), surgical technique, and postoperative management. CONCLUSIONS: Timing of tracheostomy varied from 3 to >21 days, with over 90% of protocols recommending 14 days of intubation prior to tracheostomy. Most protocols advocate delaying tracheostomy until COVID-19 testing was negative. All protocols involved use of N95 or higher PPE. Both open and percutaneous techniques were reported. Timing of tracheostomy changes ranged from 5 to >30 days postoperatively, sometimes contingent on negative COVID-19 test results. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Wide variation exists in tracheostomy protocols, reflecting geographical variation, different resource constraints, and limited data to drive evidence-based care standards. Findings presented herein may provide reference points and a framework for evolving care standards.",,Otolaryngology,,,2020-11-03,2020,,,194599820961985,All OA; Gold,Article,"Bier-Laning, Carol; Cramer, John D;

To investigate the immune characteristics of early SARS-CoV-2 infection in children and possible key prognostic factors for early identification of critical COVID-19, a retrospective study including 121 children with COVID-19 was conducted.  Peripheral blood lymphocyte subset counts, T cell-derived cytokine concentrations, inflammatory factor concentrations, and routine blood counts were analyzed statistically at the initial presentation.  Results The T lymphocyte subset and natural killer cell counts decreased with increasing disease severity. Group III (critical cases) had a higher Th/Tc ratio than groups I and II (common and severe cases); group I had a higher B cell count than groups II and III. IL-6, IL-10, IFN-γ, SAA, and procalcitonin levels increased with disease severity. Hemoglobin concentration, and RBC and eosinophil counts decreased with disease severity. Groups II and III had significantly lower lymphocyte counts than group I. T, Th, Tc, IL-6, IL-10, RBC, and hemoglobin had relatively high contribution and area under the curve values.  Conclusions Decreased T, Th, Tc, RBC, hemoglobin and increased IL-6 and IL-10 in early SARS-CoV-2 infection in children are valuable indices for early diagnosis of disease severity.  The significantly reduced Th and Tc cells and significantly increased IL-6, IL-10, ferritin, procalcitonin, and SAA at this stage in children with critical COVID-19 may be closely associated with the systemic cytokine storm caused by immune dysregulation.",,Research Square,,,2020-11-03,2020,,,,"All OA; Green, Published",Preprint,"Lu, Wenjie; Lu, Wenjie; Yang, Li; Yang, Li; Li, Xiong; Li, Xiong; Qi, Shanshan; Qi, Shanshan; Zhang, Aiping; Zhang, Aiping; Sun, Ming; Sun, Ming; Chen, Zhi; Chen, Zhi; Zhang, Lannan; Zhang, Lannan; Li, Jianxin; Li, Jianxin; Xiong, Hao","Lu, Wenjie (Wuhan Children's Hospital); Yang, Li (Wuhan Children's Hospital); Li, Xiong (University of Michigan School of Medicine, Ann Arbor, MI, USA); Qi, Shanshan (Wuhan Children's Hospital); Zhang, Aiping (Wuhan Children's Hospital); Sun, Ming (Wuhan Children's Hospital); Chen, Zhi (Wuhan Children's Hospital); Zhang, Lannan (Wuhan Children's Hospital); Li, Jianxin (Wuhan Children's Hospital); Xiong, Hao (Wuhan Children's Hospital)",,"Lu, Wenjie (Wuhan Children's Hospital); Yang, Li (Wuhan Children's Hospital); Li, Xiong (University of Michigan); Qi, Shanshan (Wuhan Children's Hospital); Zhang, Aiping (Wuhan Children's Hospital); Sun, Ming (Wuhan Children's Hospital); Chen, Zhi (Wuhan Children's Hospital); Zhang, Lannan (Wuhan Children's Hospital); Li, Jianxin (Wuhan Children's Hospital); Xiong, Hao (Wuhan Children's Hospital)",University of Michigan; Wuhan Children's Hospital,grid.214458.e; grid.417274.3,United States; China,,0,0,,,1,https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-101151/v1.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1132291793,11 Medical and Health Sciences; 1107 Immunology,

However, outcomes in patients with COVID-19 with both cancer and comorbid CVD are unknown. METHODS: This retrospective study included 2,476 patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 at 4 Massachusetts hospitals between March 11 and May 21, 2020. Patients were stratified by a history of either cancer (n=195) or CVD (n=414) and subsequently by the presence of both cancer and CVD (n=82). We compared outcomes between patients with and without cancer and patients with both cancer and CVD compared with patients with either condition alone. The primary endpoint was COVID-19-associated severe disease, defined as a composite of the need for mechanical ventilation, shock, or death. Secondary endpoints included death, shock, need for mechanical ventilation, need for supplemental oxygen, arrhythmia, venous thromboembolism, encephalopathy, abnormal troponin level, and length of stay. RESULTS: Multivariable analysis identified cancer as an independent predictor of COVID-19-associated severe disease among all infected patients. Patients with cancer were more likely to develop COVID-19-associated severe disease than were those without cancer (hazard ratio [HR], 2.02; 95% CI, 1.53-2.68; P",,Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network,,,2020-11-03,2020,,,1-10,Closed,Article,"Ganatra, Sarju;

The recommendations include: (1) Resisting the tendency to oversimplify scientific assessments by reliance on single disciplines in lieu of clear weight-of-evidence expressions, and on single quantitative point estimates of health protective values for policy decisions; (2) Improving the separation of science and judgment in risk assessment through the use of clear expressions of the range of judgments that bracket protective quantitative levels for public health protection; (3) Use of comparative risk to achieve the greatest gains in health and the environment; and (4) Where applicable, reversal of the risk assessment and risk management steps to facilitate timely and substantive improvements in public health and the environment. Lessons learned and improvements in the risk assessment process are applied to the unprecedented challenges of the 21st century such as, pandemics and climate change. The beneficial application of the risk assessment and risk management paradigm to ensure timely research with consistency and transparency of assessments is presented. Institutions with mandated stability and leadership roles at the national and international levels are essential to ensure timely interdisciplinary scientific assessment at the interface with public policy as a basis for organized policy decisions, to meet time sensitive goals, and to inform the public.",Authors received no external funding to support the preparation of this manuscript and report no competing interests.

BACKGROUND: COVID-19 related social and physical distancing measures increase the risk for individuals who are socially isolated with partners who perpetuate violence. Providing support through telehealth is one strategy that can mitigate the pandemic of IPV, while helping patients and providers stay safe from COVID-19. DESIGN AND METHODS: In this discursive paper, we describe how practical guidance for safely recognizing and responding to IPV in telehealth encounters was developed. The ADAPT-ITT (Assessment, Decisions, Administration, Production, Topical Experts, Integration, Testing, Training) framework was used to guide the novel identification and adaptation of evidence-informed. We focused on the first six stages of the ADAPT-ITT framework. CONCLUSIONS: This paper fills a gap in available guidance, specifically for IPV recognition and response via telehealth. We present strategies for prioritizing safety and promoting privacy while initiating, managing, or terminating a telehealth encounter with patients who may be at risk for or experiencing IPV. Strategies for assessment, planning, and intervention are also summarized. System level responses, such as increasing equitable access to telecommunication technology are also discussed. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Integrating innovative IPV-focused practices into telehealth care is an important opportunity for nurses and midwives during the current global COVID-19 pandemic. There are also implications for future secondary outbreaks, natural disasters, or other physically isolating events, for improving healthcare efficiency, and for addressing the needs of vulnerable populations with limited access to healthcare.",,Journal of Clinical Nursing,,,2020-11-03,2020,,,,Closed,Article,"Jack, Susan M.; Munro‐Kramer, Michelle L.; Williams, Jessica Roberts; Schminkey, Donna; Tomlinson, Elizabeth; Mayo‐Wilson, Larissa Jennings; Bradbury‐Jones, Caroline; Campbell, Jacquelyn C.","Jack, Susan M.

In 2011, the Ghana National Cancer Steering Committee created a guideline recommending fecal occult blood testing (FOBT) for CRC screening in individuals over the age of 50. There is limited data available on current Ghanaian CRC screening trends and adherence to the established guidelines. METHODS: We conducted a survey of 39 physicians working at the Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital in Kumasi, Ghana. The survey evaluates physician knowledge, practice patterns, and perceived personal-, patient- and system-level barriers pertaining to CRC screening. RESULTS: Almost 10% of physicians would not recommend colorectal cancer screening for asymptomatic, average risk patients who met the age inclusion criteria set forth in the national guidelines. Only 1 physician would recommend FOBT as an initial screening test for CRC. The top reasons for not recommending CRC screening with FOBT were the lack of equipment/facilities for the test (28.1%) and lack of training (18.8%). The two most commonly identified barriers to screening identified by >85% of physicians, were lack of awareness of screening/not perceiving colorectal cancer as a serious health threat (patient-level) and high screening costs/lack of insurance coverage (system-level). CONCLUSION: Despite creation of national guidelines for CRC screening, there has been low uptake and implementation. This is due to several barriers at the physician-, patient- and system-levels including lack of resources and physician training to follow-up on positive screening results, limited monetary support and substantial gaps in knowledge at the patient level.",,World Journal of Surgery,,,2020-11-03,2020,,,1-14,All OA; Gold,Article,"Lussiez, Alisha; Dualeh, Shukri H.

We examined the effect of prenatal exposure to the Great Chinese Famine (1958-1962)-the largest famine in human history-on pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) across consecutive generations in a major center of ongoing transmission in China. We analyzed >1 million PTB cases diagnosed between 2005 and 2018 in Sichuan Province using age-period-cohort analysis and mixed-effects metaregression to estimate the effect of the famine on PTB risk in the directly affected birth cohort (F1) and their likely offspring (F2). The analysis was repeated on certain sexually transmitted and blood-borne infections (STBBI) to explore potential mechanisms of the intergenerational effects. A substantial burden of active PTB in the exposed F1 cohort and their offspring was attributable to the Great Chinese Famine, with more than 12,000 famine-attributable active PTB cases (>1.23% of all cases reported between 2005 and 2018). An interquartile range increase in famine intensity resulted in a 6.53% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.19-12.14%) increase in the ratio of observed to expected incidence rate (incidence rate ratio, IRR) in the absence of famine in F1, and an 8.32% (95% CI: 0.59-16.6%) increase in F2 IRR. Increased risk of STBBI was also observed in F2. Prenatal and early-life exposure to malnutrition may increase the risk of active PTB in the exposed generation and their offspring, with the intergenerational effect potentially due to both within-household transmission and increases in host susceptibility.","This work was supported in part by NSF Grant 2032210; NIH Grants R01AI125842, R01AI148336, and R01TW010286; and by the University of California Multicampus Research Programs and Initiatives Award #17-446315.",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,,,2020-11-03,2020,117,44,27549-27555,Closed,Article,"Cheng, Qu; Trangucci, Robert; Nelson, Kristin N.; Fu, Wenjiang; Collender, Philip A.; Head, Jennifer R.; Hoover, Christopher M.; Skaff, Nicholas K.; Li, Ting; Li, Xintong; You, Yue; Fang, Liqun; Liang, Song; Yang, Changhong; He, Jin’ge; Zelner, Jonathan L.; Remais, Justin V.","Cheng, Qu (University of California); Trangucci, Robert (University of Michigan); Nelson, Kristin N.

Lung histopathology often reveals fibrin-based occlusions in the small blood vessels of patients who succumb to the disease. Antiphospholipid syndrome is an acquired and potentially life-threatening thrombophilia in which patients develop pathogenic autoantibodies targeting phospholipids and phospholipid-binding proteins (aPL antibodies). Case series have recently detected aPL antibodies in patients with COVID-19. Here, we measured eight types of aPL antibodies in serum samples from 172 patients hospitalized with COVID-19. These aPL antibodies included anticardiolipin IgG, IgM and IgA; anti-β2 glycoprotein I IgG, IgM, and IgA; and anti-phosphatidylserine/ prothrombin (aPS/PT) IgG and IgM. We detected aPS/PT IgG in 24% of serum samples, anticardiolipin IgM in 23% of samples, and aPS/PT IgM in 18% of samples. Antiphospholipid autoantibodies were present in 52% of serum samples using the manufacturer's threshold and in 30% using a more stringent cutoff (≥40 ELISA-specific units). Higher titers of aPL antibodies were associated with neutrophil hyperactivity including the release of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), higher platelet counts, more severe respiratory disease, and lower clinical estimated glomerular filtration rate. Similar to IgG from patients with antiphospholipid syndrome, IgG fractions isolated from COVID-19 patients promoted NET release from neutrophils isolated from healthy individuals. Furthermore, injection of IgG purified from COVID-19 patient serum into mice accelerated venous thrombosis in two mouse models. These findings suggest that half of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 become at least transiently positive for aPL antibodies and that these autoantibodies are potentially pathogenic.",,Science Translational Medicine,,,2020-11-02,2020,,,,Closed,Article,"Zuo, Yu; Estes, Shanea K; Ali, Ramadan A; Gandhi, Alex A; Yalavarthi, Srilakshmi; Shi, Hui; Sule, Gautam; Gockman, Kelsey; Madison, Jacqueline A; Zuo, Melanie; Yadav, Vinita; Wang, Jintao; Woodard, Wrenn; Lezak, Sean P; Lugogo, Njira L; Smith, Stephanie A; Morrissey, James H; Kanthi, Yogendra; Knight, Jason S","Zuo, Yu (Division of Rheumatology, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48109, USA.); Estes, Shanea K (Division of Rheumatology, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48109, USA.); Ali, Ramadan A (Division of Rheumatology, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48109, USA.); Gandhi, Alex A (Division of Rheumatology, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48109, USA.); Yalavarthi, Srilakshmi (Division of Rheumatology, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48109, USA.); Shi, Hui (Division of Rheumatology, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48109, USA.; Division of Rheumatology, Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.); Sule, Gautam (Division of Rheumatology, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48109, USA.); Gockman, Kelsey (Division of Rheumatology, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48109, USA.); Madison, Jacqueline A (Division of Rheumatology, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48109, USA.); Zuo, Melanie (Division of Geriatric and Palliative Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48109, USA.); Yadav, Vinita (Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48109, USA.); Wang, Jintao (Division of Intramural Research National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute Bethesda, Maryland 20892, USA.); Woodard, Wrenn (Michigan Clinical Research Unit, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48109, USA.); Lezak, Sean P (Michigan Clinical Research Unit, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48109, USA.); Lugogo, Njira L (Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48109, USA.); Smith, Stephanie A (Department of Biological Chemistry, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48109, USA.); Morrissey, James H (Department of Biological Chemistry, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48109, USA.); Kanthi, Yogendra (Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48109, USA. yogen.kanthi@nih.gov jsknight@umich.edu.; Division of Intramural Research National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute Bethesda, Maryland 20892, USA.); Knight, Jason S (Division of Rheumatology, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48109, USA. yogen.kanthi@nih.gov jsknight@umich.edu.)",,"Zuo, Yu (University of Michigan); Estes, Shanea K (University of Michigan); Ali, Ramadan A (University of Michigan); Gandhi, Alex A (University of Michigan); Yalavarthi, Srilakshmi (University of Michigan); Shi, Hui (University of Michigan; Shanghai Jiao Tong University); Sule, Gautam (University of Michigan); Gockman, Kelsey (University of Michigan); Madison, Jacqueline A (University of Michigan); Zuo, Melanie (University of Michigan); Yadav, Vinita (University of Michigan); Wang, Jintao (); Woodard, Wrenn (University of Michigan); Lezak, Sean P (University of Michigan); Lugogo, Njira L (University of Michigan); Smith, Stephanie A (University of Michigan); Morrissey, James H (University of Michigan); Kanthi, Yogendra (University of Michigan); Knight, Jason S (University of Michigan)",University of Michigan; Shanghai Jiao Tong University,grid.214458.e; grid.16821.3c,United States; China,National Heart Lung and Blood Institute,1,1,,,817,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1132272848,11 Medical and Health Sciences; 1107 Immunology,

Within prevention science, youth mentoring programs emphasize creating a specific context that benefits a young person. Program-sponsored relationships between youth and adults allow for creating a mentor-mentee partnership, but do not require the establishment of a strong bond in order to deliver prevention-focused activities and experiences (Handbook of Youth Mentoring, Los Angeles, SAGE, 2014). Motivational Interviewing (MI) is a counseling style used widely to promote health behavior change and in prevention interventions. As part of an upstream approach to HIV prevention, we combined mentoring and MI by training peer mentors to use MI skills in their interactions as part of a large RCT of a mobile life skills intervention for adolescent men who have sex with men (AMSM). Our training model developed for training peer mentors in MI skills resulted in peers reaching and exceeding established MI fidelity thresholds (e.g., mean percentage of complex reflections = 80%, mean reflection to question ratio = 2.2:1). We offer reflections on lessons learned and future directions for those researchers and practitioners who may benefit from adapting this blended approach for mentoring AMSM.",The work described herein was funded by a grant from the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities (MD011274).

Underrepresented in both scholarship and organizing efforts, eviction and displacement pose unique threats to seniors because of the link between their health and housing needs. To uncover possible strategies for coalition building and senior housing policy advocacy in quickly changing neighborhoods, this article examines the strategic efforts of Senior Housing Preservation-Detroit (SHP-D). Originally formed in 2013 to address the displacement of a single building of seniors, SHP-D aims to raise awareness of and advocate to preserve housing in a city whose core is rapidly changing. In this article, we offer an overview of the coalition’s advocacy as a way to highlight the role of community mobilization toward preserving affordable senior housing. We outline (a) the formation of the coalition, (b) recent developments, (c) strategic planning processes, and (d) lessons learned by this coalition that may be useful for other senior housing advocacy efforts.

Targeted universalism, wellness-based local development, and Jedi Public Health approaches that are community informed, evidence based, and focused on improving everyday settings and diverse lived experiences are important policy directions. State and federal revenue transfers are necessary to mitigate the harms of austerity and assure greater equity in fiscal and population health in places like Detroit, Michigan. CONTEXT: US population health inequity remains entrenched, despite mandates to eliminate it. To promote a public health approach of consequence in this domain, stakeholders call for moving from risk-factor epidemiology toward consideration of dynamic local variations in the physiological impacts of structured lived experience. METHODS: Using a community-based, participatory research approach, we collected and analyzed a unique data set of 239 black, white, and Mexican adults from a stratified, multistage probability sample of three Detroit, Michigan, neighborhoods. We drew venous blood, collected saliva, took anthropometric measurements, and assayed specimens to measure allostatic load (AL), an indicator of stress-mediated biological dysregulation, linking participants' AL scores and survey responses. In a series of nested Poisson models, we regressed AL on socioeconomic, psychosocial, neighborhood, and behavioral stressors to test the hypothesis that race/ethnicity and poverty-to-income ratio (PIR) are conceptually fluctuating variables whose impacts on AL are sensitive to structured lived experience. FINDINGS: White and Mexican Detroit participants with PIR < 1 have higher AL than counterparts nationally; black participants in Detroit and nationwide had comparable AL. Within Detroit, disparities by PIR were higher in whites than blacks, with no significant difference by PIR in Mexicans. The size of estimated effects of having PIR < 1 for whites is 58 percentage points greater than that of Mexicans and twice that of blacks. CONCLUSIONS: Structurally rooted unobserved heterogeneity bias threatens the validity of independent main effects interpretations of associations between race/ethnicity, socioeconomic characteristics, or place and health. One-size-fits-all analytic or policy models developed from the perspective of the dominant social group insufficiently address the experiences of diverse populations in specific settings and historical moments; nor do they recognize culturally mediated protective resources residents may have developed against material and psychosocial hardship.",,Milbank Quarterly,,,2020-11-02,2020,,,,Closed,Article,"GERONIMUS, ARLINE T.; PEARSON, JAY A.; LINNENBRINGER, ERIN; EISENBERG, ALEXA K.; STOKES, CARMEN; HUGHES, LANDON D.; SCHULZ, AMY J.","GERONIMUS, ARLINE T.

But, unlike other engineering and management disciplines, it lacks a clear foundation in a descriptive science. Exceptional results like the famous “bullwhip effect” paper by Lee, Padmanabhan and Whang (1997) hint at the powerful potential for a descriptive science of operations. But the very fact that such works are exceptional suggests that they are held to a high bar in the publishing process. This may be symptomatic of the cultural norms that have prevented our field from producing a rigorous scientific foundation. In this paper we make a case for why developing a unified science of operations is essential for IE/OM education, practice and research. We provide examples and a tentative framework to illustrate what such a science might look like and use this framework to generate a testable hypothesis about a powerful relationship between variability buffers in and operations system.

There are significant disparities in morbidity and mortality by sex, weight, and diabetes status. Numerous endocrine changes might drive these varied responses to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, including hormone and immune mediators, hyperglycemia, leukocyte responses, cytokine secretion, and tissue dysfunction. Studies of patients with severe COVID-19 disease have revealed the importance of innate immune responses in driving immunopathology and tissue injury. In this review we will describe the impact of the metabolically induced inflammation (meta-inflammation) that characterizes obesity on innate immunity. We consider that obesity-driven dysregulation of innate immune responses may drive organ injury in the development of severe COVID-19 and impair viral clearance.",,Endocrinology,,"Betacoronavirus; Body Weight; Coronavirus Infections; Host-Pathogen Interactions; Humans; Immunity, Innate; Inflammation; Obesity; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Severity of Illness Index",2020-11-01,2020,161,11,bqaa154-,All OA; Gold,Article,"Huizinga, Gabrielle P; Singer, Benjamin H; Singer, Kanakadurga","Huizinga, Gabrielle P (Graduate Program in Immunology, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI USA); Singer, Benjamin H (Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI USA); Singer, Kanakadurga (Department of Pediatrics and Department of Molecular and Integrative Physiology, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI USA)",,"Huizinga, Gabrielle P (University of Michigan); Singer, Benjamin H (University of Michigan); Singer, Kanakadurga (University of Michigan)",University of Michigan,grid.214458.e,United States,National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke; National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases,0,0,,,135,https://academic.oup.com/endo/article-pdf/161/11/bqaa154/34030975/bqaa154.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1130548623,11 Medical and Health Sciences; 1103 Clinical Sciences; 1107 Immunology,3 Good Health and Well Being

Objectives: To assess factors associated with death and to examine interhospital variation in treatment and outcomes for patients with COVID-19. Design, Setting, and Participants: This multicenter cohort study assessed 2215 adults with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 who were admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) at 65 hospitals across the US from March 4 to April 4, 2020. Exposures: Patient-level data, including demographics, comorbidities, and organ dysfunction, and hospital characteristics, including number of ICU beds. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was 28-day in-hospital mortality. Multilevel logistic regression was used to evaluate factors associated with death and to examine interhospital variation in treatment and outcomes. Results: A total of 2215 patients (mean [SD] age, 60.5 [14.5] years; 1436 [64.8%] male; 1738 [78.5%] with at least 1 chronic comorbidity) were included in the study. At 28 days after ICU admission, 784 patients (35.4%) had died, 824 (37.2%) were discharged, and 607 (27.4%) remained hospitalized. At the end of study follow-up (median, 16 days; interquartile range, 8-28 days), 875 patients (39.5%) had died, 1203 (54.3%) were discharged, and 137 (6.2%) remained hospitalized. Factors independently associated with death included older age (≥80 vs <40 years of age: odds ratio [OR], 11.15; 95% CI, 6.19-20.06), male sex (OR, 1.50; 95% CI, 1.19-1.90), higher body mass index (≥40 vs <25: OR, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.01-2.25), coronary artery disease (OR, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.07-2.02), active cancer (OR, 2.15; 95% CI, 1.35-3.43), and the presence of hypoxemia (Pao2:Fio2<100 vs ≥300 mm Hg: OR, 2.94; 95% CI, 2.11-4.08), liver dysfunction (liver Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score of 2 vs 0: OR, 2.61; 95% CI, 1.30-5.25), and kidney dysfunction (renal Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score of 4 vs 0: OR, 2.43; 95% CI, 1.46-4.05) at ICU admission. Patients admitted to hospitals with fewer ICU beds had a higher risk of death (<50 vs ≥100 ICU beds: OR, 3.28; 95% CI, 2.16-4.99). Hospitals varied considerably in the risk-adjusted proportion of patients who died (range, 6.6%-80.8%) and in the percentage of patients who received hydroxychloroquine, tocilizumab, and other treatments and supportive therapies. Conclusions and Relevance: This study identified demographic, clinical, and hospital-level risk factors that may be associated with death in critically ill patients with COVID-19 and can facilitate the identification of medications and supportive therapies to improve outcomes.",,JAMA Internal Medicine,,,2020-11-01,2020,180,11,1436,All OA; Gold,Article,"Gupta, Shruti; Hayek, Salim S.; Wang, Wei; Chan, Lili; Mathews, Kusum S.; Melamed, Michal L.; Brenner, Samantha K.; Leonberg-Yoo, Amanda; Schenck, Edward J.; Radbel, Jared; Reiser, Jochen; Bansal, Anip; Srivastava, Anand; Zhou, Yan; Sutherland, Anne; Green, Adam; Shehata, Alexandre M.; Goyal, Nitender; Vijayan, Anitha; Velez, Juan Carlos Q.; Shaefi, Shahzad; Parikh, Chirag R.; Arunthamakun, Justin; Athavale, Ambarish M.; Friedman, Allon N.; Short, Samuel A.

This review identifies patient-centered practices that ensure safety and reduce risk of infection transmission to health care workers during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. METHODS: Consensus statements, guidelines, institutional recommendations, and scientific literature on COVID-19 and previous outbreaks were reviewed. A global interdisciplinary team analyzed and prioritized findings via electronic communications and video conferences to develop consensus recommendations. RESULTS: Aerosol-generating procedures are commonly performed by nurses and other health care workers, most notably during suctioning, tracheostomy tube changes, and stoma care. Patient repositioning, readjusting circuits, administering nebulized medications, and patient transport also present risks. Standard personal protective equipment includes an N95/FFP3 mask with or without surgical masks, gloves, goggles, and gown when performing aerosol-generating procedures for patients with known or suspected COVID-19. Viral testing of bronchial aspirate via tracheostomy may inform care providers when determining the protective equipment required. The need for protocols to reduce risk of transmission of infection to nurses and other health care workers is evident. CONCLUSION: Critical care nurses and multidisciplinary teams often care for patients with a tracheostomy who are known or suspected to have COVID-19. Appropriate care of these patients relies on safeguarding the health care team. The practices described in this review may greatly reduce risk of infectious transmission.",,American Journal of Critical Care,,,2020-11-01,2020,29,6,e116-e127,All OA; Gold,Article,"Pandian, Vinciya; Morris, Linda L; Brodsky, Martin B; Lynch, James; Walsh, Brian; Rushton, Cynda; Phillips, Jane; Rahman, Alphonsa; DeRose, Troy; Lambe, Leah; Lami, Lionel; Wu, Sarah Pui Man; Garza, Francisco Paredes; Maiani, Simona; Zavalis, Andrea; Okusanya, Kafilat Ajoke; Palmieri, Patrick A; McGrath, Brendan A; Pelosi, Paolo; Sole, Mary Lou; Davidson, Patricia; Brenner, Michael J","Pandian, Vinciya (Vinciya Pandian is associate professor, Department of Nursing Faculty, and Outcomes After Critical Illness and Surgery (OACIS) Research Group, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland.); Morris, Linda L (Linda L.

It starts with the premise that the precursors of catastrophes of this magnitude provide a valid basis for planning corrective measures, improved preparedness, and ultimately serious health reform. Such reform should include standardized protocols for proper deployment of telemedicine to triage patients to the appropriate level and source of care at the point of need, proper use of relevant technological innovations to deliver precision medicine, and the development of regional networks to coordinate and improve access to care while streamlining the care process. The other essential element is a universal payment system that puts the United States at par with the rest of the industrialized countries, regardless of variation among them. The ultimate goal is creating an efficient, effective, accessible, and equitable system of care. Although timing is uncertain, the pandemic will be brought under control.

163,pub.1131672337,10.1002/jmv.26597,33090512,,Effects of SARS‐CoV‐2 mutations on protein structures and intraviral protein–protein interactions,"Since 2019, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS- CoV-2) causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has infected ten millions of people across the globe, and massive mutations in virus genome have occurred during the rapid spread of this novel coronavirus. Variance in protein sequence might lead to change in protein structure and interaction, then further affect the viral physiological characteristics, which could bring tremendous influence on the pandemic. In this study, we investigated 20 non-synonymous mutations in SARS-CoV-2 genome which incidence rates were all ≥1% as of September 1st, 2020, then modeled and analyzed the mutant protein structures. The results showed that four types of mutations caused dramatic changes in protein structures (RMSD ≥5.0 Å), which were Q57H and G251V in open reading frames 3a (ORF3a), S194L and R203K/G204R in nucleocapsid (N). Next, we found that these mutations also affected the binding affinity of intraviral protein interactions. In addition, the hot spots within these docking mutant complexes were altered, among which the mutation Q57H was involved in both Orf3a-S and Orf3a-Orf8 protein interactions. Besides, these mutations were widely distributed all over the world, and their occurrences fluctuated as time went on. Notably, the incidences of R203K/G204R in N and Q57H in Orf3a were both over 50% in some countries. Overall, our findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 mutations could change viral protein structure, binding affinity and hot spots of the interface, thereby might have impacts on SARS-CoV-2 transmission, diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19.

Clinical research in hepatology has had a rich tradition in several domains, including the discovery and therapeutic development for diseases such as hepatitis B and C and studying the natural history of many forms of chronic liver disease. National Institutes of Health, foundation, and industry funding have provided important opportunities to advance the academic careers of young investigators while they strived to make contributions to the field. Instantaneously, however, all nonessential research activities were halted when the pandemic started, forcing those involved in clinical research to rethink their research strategy, including a shift to coronavirus disease 2019 research while endeavoring to maintain their preexisting agenda. Strategies to maintain the integrity of ongoing studies, including patient follow-up, safety assessments, and continuation of investigational products, have included a shift to telemedicine, remote safety laboratory monitoring, and shipping of investigational products to study subjects. As a revamp of research is being planned, unique issues that face the research community include maintenance of infrastructure, funding, completion of studies in the predetermined time frame, and the need to reprogram career path timelines. Real-world databases, biomarker and long-term follow up studies, and research involving special groups (children, the homeless, and other marginalized populations) are likely to face unique challenges. The implementation of telemedicine has been dramatically accelerated and will serve as a backbone for the future of clinical research. As we move forward, innovation in clinical trial design will be essential for conducting optimized clinical research.","AASLD COVID‐19 Clinical Oversight Subcommittee (COS): Oren K.

76,pub.1131104361,10.1681/asn.2020060829,32963090,,Soluble Urokinase Receptor (SuPAR) in COVID-19–Related AKI,"BACKGROUND: AKI commonly occurs in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Its pathogenesis is poorly understood. The urokinase receptor system is a key regulator of the intersection between inflammation, immunity, and coagulation, and soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR) has been identified as an immunologic risk factor for AKI. Whether suPAR is associated with COVID-19-related AKI is unknown. METHODS: In a multinational observational study of adult patients hospitalized for COVID-19, we measured suPAR levels in plasma samples from 352 adult patients that had been collected within 48 hours of admission. We examined the association between suPAR levels and incident in-hospital AKI. RESULTS: Of the 352 patients (57.4% were male, 13.9% were black, and mean age was 61 years), 91 (25.9%) developed AKI during their hospitalization, of whom 25 (27.4%) required dialysis. The median suPAR level was 5.61 ng/ml. AKI incidence rose with increasing suPAR tertiles, from a 6.0% incidence in patients with suPAR <4.60 ng/ml (first tertile) to a 45.8% incidence of AKI in patients with suPAR levels >6.86 ng/ml (third tertile). None of the patients with suPAR <4.60 ng/ml required dialysis during their hospitalization. In multivariable analysis, the highest suPAR tertile was associated with a 9.15-fold increase in the odds of AKI (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 3.64 to 22.93) and a 22.86-fold increase in the odds of requiring dialysis (95% CI, 2.77 to 188.75). The association was independent of inflammatory markers and persisted across subgroups. CONCLUSIONS: Admission suPAR levels in patients hospitalized for COVID-19 are predictive of in-hospital AKI and the need for dialysis. SuPAR may be a key component of the pathophysiology of AKI in COVID-19.","S.

Health care workers have been using this disinfection method during the pandemic. Our objective was to determine the effect of UVC on SARS-CoV-2 inoculated N95 respirators and whether this was respirator material/model type dependent. METHODS: Four different locations (facepiece and strap) on five different N95 FFR models (3M 1860, 8210, 8511, 9211; Moldex 1511) were inoculated with a 10 μL drop of SARS-CoV-2 viral stock (8 × 107 TCID50/mL). The outside-facing and wearer-facing surfaces of the respirators were each irradiated with a dose of 1.5 J/cm2 UVC (254 nm). Viable SARS-CoV-2 was quantified by a median tissue culture infectious dose assay (TCID50). RESULTS: UVC delivered using a dose of 1.5 J/cm2, to each side, was an effective method of decontamination for the facepieces of 3M 1860 and Moldex 1511, and for the straps of 3M 8210 and the Moldex 1511. CONCLUSION: This dose is an appropriate decontamination method to facilitate the reuse of respirators for healthcare personnel when applied to specific models/materials. Also, some straps may require additional disinfection to maximize the safety of frontline workers. Implementation of widespread UVC decontamination methods requires careful consideration of model, material type, design, and fit-testing following irradiation.",,International Journal of Infectious Diseases,,,2020-11,2020,100,,224-229,All OA; Gold,Article,"Ozog, David M; Sexton, Jonathan Z; Narla, Shanthi; Pretto-Kernahan, Carla D; Mirabelli, Carmen; Lim, Henry W; Hamzavi, Iltefat H; Tibbetts, Robert J; Mi, Qing-Sheng","Ozog, David M (Photomedicine and Photobiology Unit, Department of Dermatology, Henry Ford Health System, Detroit, MI 48202, USA.

Methods: We surveyed US transplant programs to assess practices, strategies, and barriers to living LDKT during the COVID-19 pandemic. After institutional review board approval, the survey was distributed from 9 May 2020 to 30 May 2020 by e-mail and postings to professional society list-servs. Responses were stratified based on state COVID-19 cumulative incidence levels. Results: Staff at 118 unique centers responded, representing 61% of US living donor recovery programs and 75% of LKDT volume in the prepandemic year. Overall, 66% reported that LDKT surgery was on hold (81% in ""high"" vs. 49% in ""low"" COVID-19 cumulative incidence states). A total of 36% reported that evaluation of new donor candidates had paused, 27% reported that evaluations were very much decreased (>0% to <25% typical), and 23% reported that evaluations were moderately decreased (25% to <50% typical). Barriers to LDKT surgery included program concerns for donor (85%) and recipient (75%) safety, patient concerns (56%), elective case restrictions (47%), and hospital administrative restrictions (48%). Programs with higher local COVID-19 cumulative incidence reported more barriers related to staff and resource diversion. Most centers continuing donor evaluations used remote strategies (video, 82%; telephone, 43%). As LDKT resumes, all programs will screen for COVID-19, although timeframe and modalities will vary. Recommendations for presurgical self-quarantine are also variable. Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic has had broad impacts on LDKT practice. Ongoing research and consensus building are needed to reduce barriers, to guide optimal practices, and to support safe restoration of LDKT across centers.","ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS The authors thank survey respondents, including members of the American Society of Transplantation (AST) Kidney Pancreas Community of Practice (COP), Live Donor COP, and AST Outstanding Questions in Transplantation list servs, and the AST Education Committee for review of the survey instrument.

Many of these changes may add value to care, creating opportunities going forward. OBJECTIVE: To provide an evidence-informed, expert-derived review of genitourinary cancer care moving forward following the initial COVID-19 pandemic. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: A collaborative narrative review was conducted using literature published through May 2020 (PubMed), which comprised three main topics: reduced in-person interactions arguing for increasing virtual and image-based care, optimisation of the delivery of care, and the effect of COVID-19 in health care facilities on decision-making by patients and their families. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Patterns of care will evolve following the COVID-19 pandemic. Telemedicine, virtual care, and telemonitoring will increase and could offer broader access to multidisciplinary expertise without increasing costs. Comprehensive and integrative telehealth solutions will be necessary, and should consider patients' mental health and access differences due to socioeconomic status. Investigations and treatments will need to maximise efficiency and minimise health care interactions. Solutions such as one stop clinics, day case surgery, hypofractionated radiotherapy, and oral or less frequent drug dosing will be preferred. The pandemic necessitated a triage of those patients whose treatment should be expedited, delayed, or avoided, and may persist with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) in circulation. Patients whose demographic characteristics are at the highest risk of complications from COVID-19 may re-evaluate the benefit of intervention for less aggressive cancers. Clinical research will need to accommodate virtual care and trial participation. Research dissemination and medical education will increasingly utilise virtual platforms, limiting in-person professional engagement; ensure data dissemination; and aim to enhance patient engagement. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic will have lasting effects on the delivery of health care. These changes offer opportunities to improve access, delivery, and the value of care for patients with genitourinary cancers but raise concerns that physicians and health administrators must consider in order to ensure equitable access to care. PATIENT SUMMARY: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has dramatically changed the care provided to many patients with genitourinary cancers. This has necessitated a transition to telemedicine, changes in threshold or delays in many treatments, and an opportunity to reimagine patient care to maintain safety and improve value moving forward.",,European Urology,,"Communicable Disease Control; Coronavirus Infections; Delivery of Health Care; Humans; Mental Health; Organizational Innovation; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Practice Patterns, Physicians'; Telemedicine; Urogenital Neoplasms",2020-11,2020,78,5,731-742,"All OA; Green, Published",Article,"Wallis, Christopher J D; Catto, James W F; Finelli, Antonio; Glaser, Adam W; Gore, John L; Loeb, Stacy; Morgan, Todd M; Morgans, Alicia K; Mottet, Nicolas; Neal, Richard; O'Brien, Tim; Odisho, Anobel Y; Powles, Thomas; Skolarus, Ted A; Smith, Angela B; Szabados, Bernadett; Klaassen, Zachary; Spratt, Daniel E","Wallis, Christopher J D (Department of Urology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA.

Considerations of preventing SARS-CoV-2 transmission, conserving personal protective equipment, and prioritizing care delivery based on acuity have dictated clinical decision making in the acute phase of the pandemic. With transition to a more chronic state of pandemic, heightened vigilance is necessary to recognize how deferral of care in patients with tenuous airways and COVID-19 infection may lead to acute airway compromise. Furthermore, it is critical to respect the continuing importance of flexible laryngoscopy in diagnosis. Safely managing airways during the pandemic requires thoughtful multidisciplinary planning. Teams should consider trade-offs among aerosol-generating procedures involving direct laryngoscopy, supraglottic airway use, fiberoptic intubation, and tracheostomy.

Our secondary objectives were to determine the types of medications that the older adults are more likely to restrict and to determine the factors that influence these decisions. DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey experiment in which participants read 6 scenarios, each stating that they had a 3-day supply of a particular medication remaining. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: National Web-based survey distributed to 1457 U.S. adults aged 65 years and older by Dynata from March 25, 2020, to April 1, 2020. OUTCOME MEASURES: Participants reported whether they would go to a pharmacy, have a medication delivered, or restrict the use of each medication. They reported their perceptions and experiences with COVID-19, health risk factors, preferences for more or less care (medical maximizer-minimizer), medication attitudes (beliefs about medicines questionnaire), health literacy, prescription insurance status, and demographics. RESULTS: Most participants (84%) were told to shelter in place, but only 12% reported attempting to obtain extra medications. Participants most often reported that they would go to the pharmacy to obtain each medication (ranging from tramadol 48.9% to insulin 64.9%) except for zolpidem, which they were most likely to restrict (45.4%). Participants who reported comorbidities that increased their risk of COVID-19 were just as likely to go to the pharmacy as those without. In multinomial logistic regression analyses, women and the oldest participants were more likely to seek delivery of medications. Restricting medications was most common for 2 symptom-focused medications (tramadol and zolpidem), and both demographic factors (e.g., gender) and beliefs (e.g., medical maximizing-minimizing preferences) were associated with such decisions. CONCLUSION: Many older adults intend to continue to go to the pharmacy to obtain their medications during a pandemic, even those who have health conditions that further increase their risk for COVID-19.",,Journal of the American Pharmacists Association,,,2020-11,2020,60,6,915-922.e4,All OA; Gold,Article,"Vordenberg, Sarah E.; Zikmund-Fisher, Brian J.","Vordenberg, Sarah E.

Understanding the reasons for COVID-19-related disparities among patients with asthma has important public health implications. OBJECTIVE: To determine factors contributing to health disparities in those with asthma during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: An anonymous survey was sent through social media to adult patients with asthma, and a separate survey was sent to physicians who provide asthma care. The patient survey addressed demographic information including socioeconomic status, asthma control, and attitudes/health behaviors during COVID-19. RESULTS: A total of 1171 patients (10.1% minority individuals) and 225 physicians completed the survey. Minority patients were more likely to have been affected by COVID-19 (eg, became unemployed, lived in a community with high COVID-19 cases). They had worse asthma control (increased emergency visits for asthma, lower Asthma Control Test score), were more likely to live in urban areas, and had a lower household income. Initial differences in attitudes and health behaviors disappeared after controlling for baseline demographic features. Institutional racism was demonstrated by findings that minority individuals were less likely to have a primary care physician, had more trouble affording asthma medications due to COVID-19, and were more likely to have lost health insurance because of COVID-19, and that 25% of physicians found it more challenging to care for black individuals with asthma during COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Differences in socioeconomic status and the effects of institutional racism, but not health behaviors, sources of information, or attitudes, are playing a role in disparities seen for patients with asthma during COVID-19.",,The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology In Practice,,,2020-11,2020,8,10,3371-3377.e1,Closed,Article,"Baptist, Alan P; Lowe, Desmond; Sarsour, Nadeen; Jaffee, Hannah; Eftekhari, Sanaz; Carpenter, Laurie M; Bansal, Priya","Baptist, Alan P (Division of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Mich.

However, the presence of SARS-CoV-2 has not been detected in the human eye to date. We undertook this study to analyze the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in human post-mortem ocular tissues. Methods The expression of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was assessed by RT-PCR in corneal and scleral tissues from 33 surgical-intended donors who were eliminated from a surgical use per Eye Bank Association of America (EBAA) donor screening guidelines or medical director review or positive COVID-19 test. Ocular levels of SARS-CoV-2 RNA (RT-PCR), Envelope and Spike proteins (immunohistochemistry) and anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM antibodies (ELISA) in blood were evaluated in 10 COVID-19 donors. Findings Of 132 ocular tissues from 33 surgical-intended donors, the positivity rate for SARS-CoV-2 RNA was ∼13% (17/132). Of 10 COVID-19 donors, six had PCR positive post-mortem nasopharyngeal swabs whereas eight exhibited positive post-mortem anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG levels. Among 20 eyes recovered from 10 COVID-19 donors: three conjunctival, one anterior corneal, five posterior corneal, and three vitreous swabs tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. SARS-CoV-2 spike and envelope proteins were detected in epithelial layer of the corneas that were procured without Povidone-Iodine (PVP–I) disinfection. Interpretations Our study showed a small but noteworthy prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in ocular tissues from COVID-19 donors. These findings underscore the criticality of donor screening guidelines, post-mortem nasopharyngeal PCR testing and PVP-I disinfection protocol to eliminate any tissue harboring SARS-CoV-2 being used for corneal transplantation.","This work was supported by research grants from the Eye Bank Association of America (SIM, OBS, MST, PAM, AK), National Eye Institute (AK – EY027381, EY026964), and National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (AK – AI135583, AI140033).

Prostate cancer is one of the most common cancers radiation oncology departments treat, and efficient resource utilization is essential in the setting of a pandemic. Herein, we aim to establish recommendations and a framework by which to evaluate prostate radiation therapy management decisions. Methods and Materials: Radiation oncologists from the United States and the United Kingdom rapidly conducted a systematic review and agreed upon recommendations to safely manage patients with prostate cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic. A RADS framework was created: remote visits, and avoidance, deferment, and shortening of radiation therapy was applied to determine appropriate approaches. Results: Recommendations were provided by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network risk group regarding clinical node-positive, postprostatectomy, oligometastatic, and low-volume M1 disease. Across all prostate cancer stages, telemedicine consultations and return visits were recommended when resources/staff available. Delays in consultations and return visits of between 1 and 6 months were deemed safe based on stage of disease. Treatment can be avoided or delayed until safe for very low, low, and favorable intermediate-risk disease. Unfavorable intermediate-risk, high-risk, clinical node-positive, recurrence postsurgery, oligometastatic, and low-volume M1 disease can receive neoadjuvant hormone therapy for 4 to 6 months as necessary. Ultrahypofractionation is preferred for localized, oligometastatic, and low-volume M1, and moderate hypofractionation is preferred for postprostatectomy and clinical node positive disease. Salvage is preferred to adjuvant radiation. Conclusions: Resources can be reduced for all identified stages of prostate cancer. The RADS (remote visits, and avoidance, deferment, and shortening of radiation therapy) framework can be applied to other disease sites to help with decision making in a global pandemic.",,Advances in Radiation Oncology,,,2020-11,2020,5,Suppl 1,26-32,All OA; Gold,Article,"Zaorsky, Nicholas G; Yu, James B; McBride, Sean M; Dess, Robert T; Jackson, William C; Mahal, Brandon A; Chen, Ronald; Choudhury, Ananya; Henry, Ann; Syndikus, Isabel; Mitin, Timur; Tree, Alison; Kishan, Amar U; Spratt, Daniel E","Zaorsky, Nicholas G (Department of Radiation Oncology, Penn State Cancer Institute, Hershey, Pennsylvania.); Yu, James B (Department of Therapeutic Radiology/Radiation Oncology, Yale, New Haven, Connecticut.); McBride, Sean M (Department of Radiation Oncology, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.); Dess, Robert T (Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan.); Jackson, William C (Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan.); Mahal, Brandon A (Department of Radiation Oncology, Dana Farber, Boston, Massachusetts.); Chen, Ronald (Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Kansas, Kansas City, Kansas.); Choudhury, Ananya (Division of Cancer Sciences, University of Manchester and The Christie NHS Foundation Trust, Manchester, United Kingdom.); Henry, Ann (Department of Clinical Oncology, Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust and the University of Leeds, Leeds, United Kingdom.); Syndikus, Isabel (Department of Clinical Oncology, The Clatterbridge Cancer Centre NHS Foundation Trust, Liverpool, United Kingdom.); Mitin, Timur (Knight Cancer Institute, Department of Radiation Medicine, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, Oregon.); Tree, Alison (Radiotherapy and Imaging Division, Institute of Cancer Research, Sutton, London, United Kingdom.); Kishan, Amar U (Department of Radiation Oncology, UCLA, Los Angeles, California.); Spratt, Daniel E (Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan.)","Spratt, Daniel E (University of Michigan)","Zaorsky, Nicholas G (); Yu, James B (); McBride, Sean M (Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center); Dess, Robert T (University of Michigan); Jackson, William C (University of Michigan); Mahal, Brandon A (Dana-Farber Cancer Institute); Chen, Ronald (University of Kansas); Choudhury, Ananya (Christie Hospital NHS Foundation Trust); Henry, Ann (University of Leeds); Syndikus, Isabel (Clatterbridge Cancer Centre NHS Foundation Trust); Mitin, Timur (Oregon Health & Science University); Tree, Alison (Institute of Cancer Research); Kishan, Amar U (University of California, Los Angeles); Spratt, Daniel E (University of Michigan)","Institute of Cancer Research; Clatterbridge Cancer Centre NHS Foundation Trust; University of Michigan; University of Leeds; University of Kansas; Christie Hospital NHS Foundation Trust; Dana-Farber Cancer Institute; Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center; Oregon Health & Science University; University of California, Los Angeles",grid.18886.3f; grid.418624.d; grid.214458.e; grid.9909.9; grid.266515.3; grid.412917.8; grid.65499.37; grid.51462.34; grid.5288.7; grid.19006.3e,United Kingdom; United Kingdom; United States; United Kingdom; United States; United Kingdom; United States; United States; United States; United States,,0,0,,,4,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.adro.2020.10.003,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1132131221,11 Medical and Health Sciences; 1112 Oncology and Carcinogenesis,

Due to a shared commitment to safety, equity, and well-being, away rotations are actively being discouraged or even prohibited. As a result, students transitioning to residency encounter reduced clinical training experiences and decreased access to advising, mentorship, and research opportunities. In addition, limited exposure to residency life across subspecialties and institutions poses unique challenges during the current residency application cycle. The otolaryngology-head and neck surgery community has met these unprecedented challenges by producing diverse electronic resources for specialty-specific clinical education, as well as discussing ways to increase access to advising.

Diabetic foot ulcers (DFU) present additional challenges given their superimposed risk for severe infections and amputations. The main objectives were to develop a triage algorithm to effectively risk-stratify all DFUs for potential complications, complying with social distancing regulations, preserving personal protective equipment, and to assess feasibility of virtual care for DFU. METHODS: Longitudinal study during the COVID-19 pandemic performed at a large tertiary institution evaluating the effectiveness of a targeted triage protocol developed using a combined approach of virtual care, electronic medical record data mining, and tracing for rapid risk stratification to derive optimal care delivery methods. 2868 patients with diabetes at risk for foot complications within last 12 months were included and rates of encounters, hospitalizations, and minor amputations were compared to one year prior. RESULTS: The STRIDE protocol was implemented in 1-week and eventually included 2600 patients (90.7%) demonstrating effective triage. During normal operations, 40% (938 of 2345) of all visits were due to DFUs and none were performed virtually. After implementation, 98% face-to-face visits were due to DFU, and virtual visits increased by 21,900%. This risk stratified approach led to similar low rates of DFU-related-hospitalization and minor amputation rates 20% versus 24% (p > 0.05) during and prior the pandemic, respectively.

We report the emergency use of immunomodulatory therapy utilizing an extracorporeal selective cytopheretic device (SCD) in two patients with elevated serum interleukin (IL)-6 levels and refractory COVID-19 ARDS requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). The two patients were selected based upon clinical criteria and elevated levels of IL-6 (> 100 pg/mL) as a biomarker of inflammation. Once identified, emergency/expanded use permission for SCD treatment was obtained and patient consented. Six COVID-19 patients (4 on ECMO) with severe ARDS were also screened with IL-6 levels less than 100 pg/mL and were not treated with SCD. The two enrolled patients' PaO2/FiO2 ratios increased from 55 and 58 to 200 and 192 at 52 and 50 hours respectively. Inflammatory indices also declined with IL-6 falling from 231 and 598 pg/mL to 3.32 and 116 pg/mL respectively. IL-6/IL-10 ratios also declined from 11.8 and 18 to 0.7 and 0.62 respectively.

A retrospective multicenter study involving 52 consecutive patients (mean age 52.3, 28.9% women) with type A aortic dissection during COVID-19 pandemic was conducted at tertiary aortic centers in Michigan, Wuhan and Changsha (China). Twenty-four (46.2%) were considered clinically suspicious for COVID-19 based on radiographic lung lesions (70.8%) followed by dyspnea (25.0%), cough (12.5%) and fever (12.5%). Overall, 47 (90.4%) underwent an operation and 5 (9.6%) managed non-operatively. All suspected patients underwent a reverse-transcriptase–polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) at arrival, whereas 82.1% in the non-suspected (p=0.054). Among the 24 patients either non-operatively managed or whose operation was delayed for >24 hours, only one (4.2%) died. A total of 3 (6.4%) operated patients had a positive RT-PCR at various timings, including one non-suspected patient preoperatively and two with very recent COVID-19 infection. The first patient died of respiratory failure despite uneventful surgical repair and maximal medical management. The postoperative course of both patients with recent COVID-19 was characterized by severe coagulopathy requiring massive transfusions and prolonged ICU stay. However, both survived to hospital discharge. In light of the possible dismal outcomes associated with dual diagnoses of type A aortic dissection/COVID-19 and the higher-than-expected number of asymptomatic carriers, all type A dissection patients should be immediately tested for COVID-19.

Racial and ethnic minorities and other medically underserved populations exhibit lower uptake of cancer screening than nonminorities in the United States. The COVID-19 pandemic, which disproportionately affected minority communities, has curtailed preventive services including cancer screening to preserve personal protective equipment and prevent spread of infection. While there is evidence for a rebound from the pandemic-driven reduction in cancer screening nationally, the return may not be even across all populations, with minority population screening that was already behind becoming further behind as a result of the community ravages from COVID-19. Fear of contracting COVID-19, limited access to safety-net clinics, and personal factors like, financial, employment, and transportation issues are concerns that are intensified in medically underserved communities. Prolonged delays in cancer screening will increase cancer in the overall population from pre-COVID-19 trajectories, and elevate the cancer disparity in minority populations. Knowing the overall benefit of cancer screening versus the risk of acquiring COVID-19, utilizing at-home screening tests and keeping the COVID-19-induced delay in screening to a minimum might slow the growth of disparity.","The following authors were supported by the United States Public Health Service: R35DE026631 (to G.

METHODS: Analysis of individual-level web browsing data linked with survey responses from representative samples of Americans collected between October 2016 and February 2019. RESULTS: We estimate that approximately 84% of Americans visit a vaccine-related webpage each year. Encounters with vaccine-skeptical content are less frequent; they make up only 7.5% of vaccine-related pageviews and are encountered by only 18.5% of people annually. However, these pages are more likely to be published by untrustworthy sources. Moreover, skeptical content exposure is more common among people with less favorable vaccine attitudes. Finally, usage of online intermediaries is frequently linked to vaccine-related information exposure. Google use is differentially associated with subsequent exposure to non-skeptical content, whereas exposure to vaccine-skeptical webpages is associated with usage of webmail and, to a lesser extent, Facebook. CONCLUSIONS: Online exposure to vaccine-skeptical content is relatively rare, but vigilance is required given the potential for exposure among vulnerable audiences.",,Vaccine,,,2020-11,2020,38,49,7799-7805,"All OA; Green, Published",Article,"Guess, Andrew M; Nyhan, Brendan; O'Keeffe, Zachary; Reifler, Jason","Guess, Andrew M (Department of Politics, Princeton University, United States.

This study was performed to gather electronic clinic utilization data and to better define barriers to visit completion. METHODS: A retrospective review of 199 patients cared for by a general surgery service with subsequent referral to the electronic clinic (January 2019 to June 2019) was performed. Data regarding demographics, medical characteristics, travel distance, and postoperative complications were collected. Patients were categorized based upon visit completion. The χ2 and Fisher exact analyses were performed as appropriate. Reasons for cancellations were categorized. RESULTS: More than 1/5 of all patients (21.6%) failed to complete the visit. No differences were observed in completion rates according to the type of operation, American Society of Anesthesiologists classification, and age. The failed-completion group had a significantly (P < .05) higher proportion of non-Caucasian patients and those with a marital status of single. Travel distance had no impact. Complication rates were low. Pre-clinic readmission within 30 days contributed to failed completion. Reasons for cancellation included medical issues, technical difficulties, and patient preference to have no follow-up in the electronic clinic. CONCLUSION: Several factors contribute to a patient's failure to complete an electronic clinic visit including marital status, medical complications, technical issues, and patient preference. Electronic clinic utilization patterns also demonstrate racial disparities. Successful electronic clinic program implementation requires understanding the factors that contribute to failed visits to address them and improve access.",,Surgery,,,2020-11,2020,168,5,851-858,Closed,Article,"Kemp, Michael T.; Williams, Aaron M.; Sharma, Sriganesh B.; Biesterveld, Ben E.; Wakam, Glenn K.; Matusko, Niki; Wilson, Jesse K.; Cohen, Mark S.; Alam, Hasan B.","Kemp, Michael T.

The purpose of this narrative literature review is to describe the social determinants of poor management of type 2 diabetes among the insured population and illustrate drivers of poor outcomes beyond insurance coverage. RECENT FINDINGS: Despite the provision of health insurance, social determinants play a significant role in shaping diabetes outcomes, especially for economic instability (employment, out-of-pocket expenses associated with diabetes management), food insecurity, education and literacy, access to quality health care (health systems designed to effectively manage chronic disease), neighborhood and the built environment (segregated neighborhoods, socioeconomic conditions of communities, housing), and social and community context (discrimination, social support). Multiple social determinants shape poor diabetes outcomes among the insured. These determinants are now being further exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has created the worst economic crisis for US families since the Great Depression. The evidence of this review points to the imperative need for more multilevel intervention approaches to address these determinants in the management of diabetes.",,Current Diabetes Reports,,"Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Humans; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Social Determinants of Health",2020-11,2020,20,11,67,Closed,Article,"Patel, Minal R.","Patel, Minal R.

As health care professionals dedicated to understanding and alleviating disease, many radiation oncologists have failed to acknowledge how structural racism affects the health and well-being of the patients we aim to serve. The literature is full of descriptive statistics showing the higher incidence and mortality experienced by the Black population for health conditions ranging from infant mortality to infectious disease, including coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Acknowledgment that the root of health disparities experienced by Black people in this country are based in racism is essential to moving the nation and the field of radiation oncology forward. With this lens, a brief overview of structural and institutional racism shapes a discussion of what radiation oncologists and the organizations that represent them can do to address this scourge. As members of a technological field, we often harness the power of data to advance human health and approach challenging diseases with optimism that multidisciplinary effort can produce cure. A few principles to mitigate the longstanding issues of Black marginalization within the field have been recommended via the ATIP (Acknowledgment, Transparency, Intentionality, and rePresentation) and LEADS (Learn, Engage, Advocate, Defend, Support) approaches. However, additional introspection is encouraged. Just as individuals, practices, and organizations rallied to determine how best to address the issues related to the COVID-19 pandemic, the same investigational fervor must be applied to the issue of racism to combat this sinister and often deadly disease.",,Advances in Radiation Oncology,,,2020-11,2020,5,Suppl 1,7-14,All OA; Gold,Article,"Chapman, Christina Hunter; Gabeau, Darlene; Pinnix, Chelsea C; Deville, Curtiland; Gibbs, Iris C; Winkfield, Karen M","Chapman, Christina Hunter (Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan.; Center for Clinical Management Research, VA Ann Arbor Healthcare System, Ann Arbor, Michigan.); Gabeau, Darlene (Department of Radiation Oncology, William E.

DESIGN: In 2019 to 2020, the Association of Professors of Gynecology and Obstetrics and the Council on Resident Education in Obstetrics and Gynecology (OBGYN) outlined standard dates for residency interview offers. A cross-sectional survey of applicants queried adherence to standardized interview offers, the number of interviews offers received, interviews completed, and application characteristics. Based on data that applicants in OBGYN with a mean number of 12 contiguous ranks are highly likely to match, factors associated with accepting an excessive percentage of interview offers were investigated in applicants with at least 12 interviews, using multiple logistic regression. SETTING: All OBGYN applicants were sent an anonymous electronic survey distributed through the Electronic Residency Application Service in February 2020, with the subset of US MD senior respondents selected for this analysis. PARTICIPANTS: There were a total of 1292 US MD senior applicants into OBGYN in 2020, with 505 (39%) providing their interview information through the survey. Three hundred and sixty (71%) of US MD senior respondents received at least 12 interviews. RESULTS: Applicants receiving at least 12 interview offers completed a median of 83% of their interviews, and excessive interviewing was defined as completing greater than this median percentage. Receiving most interview offers on standardized interview offer dates resulted in less excessive interviewing despite controlling for number of programs applied to, applying as a couple, and United States Medical Licensing Exams Step 1 score. CONCLUSIONS: The standardization of interview offer dates may mitigate interview inflation by altering applicant behavior. This promising pilot data suggests that applicants may be able to make more informed decisions about which interview offers to accept when all offers are received on predetermined dates.","The authors are grateful to the work of the entire APGO CREOG RRR Grant Team, including: Mark Woodland, Jessica Bienstock, John Dalrymple, Tony Ogburn, Arthur Ollendorff, David Forstein, Susan Cox, Seine Chiang, Karen George, Marc Jackson, Carol Major, Charles Kilpatrick, Erika Banks, Patricia Franz, Nicole Karjane, Saran Myers-Martin, Donna Kovacheva, Molly Georgakis, Darya Valantesevich.",Journal of Surgical Education,,,2020-11,2020,,,,Closed,Article,"Santos-Parker, Keli S; Morgan, Helen Kang; Katz, Nadine T; Marzano, David A; Strand, Eric A; Winkel, Abigail F; Hammoud, Maya M","Santos-Parker, Keli S (University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, Michigan.

Several clinical trials evaluate investigational adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated gene transfer approaches for the treatment of hemophilia A and B. The practical application of these approaches is nuanced by differences in AAV serotypes, transgene modifications, manufacturing, dosing, administration, and approach to follow-up. This guide explores mechanisms of AAV gene transfer, identification of appropriate candidates for clinical trial participation, anticipated trial events that follow infusion of an investigational gene therapy including outcomes to be monitored, and future considerations. Patient-accessible infographic summaries of these topics are included to serve as potential visual aids that healthcare providers may choose to utilize or adapt to guide informed consultation. The fundamentals of AAV-mediated, liver-directed gene transfer for hemophilia are reviewed, to facilitate discussion between healthcare providers, patients, and their families and advocates if considering a trial of investigational gene therapy.","Medical writing support, under the guidance of the authors, was provided by Molly MacFadyen, MSc, CMC Connect, McCann Health Medical Communications, and was funded by Spark Therapeutics, Philadelphia, PA, USA in accordance with Good Publication Practice (GPP3) guidelines (Ann Intern Med 2015;163:461–4).",Blood Reviews,,,2020-11,2020,,,100759,Closed,Article,"Sidonio, Robert F.; Pipe, Steven W.; Callaghan, Michael U.; Valentino, Leonard A.; Monahan, Paul E.; Croteau, Stacy E.","Sidonio, Robert F.

Our purpose was to report current and historical representation trends for Black physicians in the US RO workforce. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Public registries were used to assess significant differences in 2016 representation for US vs RO Black academic full-time faculty, residents, and applicants. Historical changes from 1970 to 2016 were reported descriptively. Linear regression was used to assess significant changes for Black residents and faculty from 1995 to 2016. RESULTS: In 2016, Black people represented 3.2% vs 1.5% (P < .001), 5.6% vs 3.2% (P = .005), and 6.5% vs 5.4% (P = .352) of US vs RO faculty, residents, and applicants, respectively. Although RO residents nearly doubled from 374 (1974) to 720 (2016), Black residents peaked at 31 in 1984 (5.9%; 31 of 522) and fell to 23 (3.2%; 23 of 720) in 2016 across 91 accredited programs; Black US graduate medical education trainees nearly doubled over the same period: 3506 (1984) to 6905 (2016). From 1995 to 2016, Black US resident representation significantly increased by 0.03%/y, but decreased significantly in RO by -0.20%/y before 2006 and did not change significantly thereafter. Over the same period, Black US faculty representation significantly increased by 0.02%/y, whereas Black RO faculty significantly increased by 0.07%/y before 2006, then decreased significantly by -0.16%/y thereafter. The number of Black RO faculty peaked at 37 in 2006 (3.1%; 37 of 1203) and was 27 (1.5%; 27 of 1769) in 2016, despite the nearly 1.5-fold increase in the number of both RO faculty and Black US faculty overall (4169 in 2006 and 6047 in 2016) during that period. CONCLUSIONS: Black physicians remain disproportionately underrepresented in RO despite an increasing available pipeline in the US physician workforce. Deliberate efforts to understand barriers to specialty training and inclusion, along with evidence-based targeted interventions to overcome them, are needed to ensure diversification of the RO physician workforce.",,International Journal of Radiation Oncology • Biology • Physics,,,2020-11,2020,108,4,856-863,All OA; Gold,Article,"Deville, Curtiland; Cruickshank, Ian; Chapman, Christina H.; Hwang, Wei-Ting; Wyse, Rhea; Ahmed, Awad A.; Winkfield, Karen; Thomas, Charles R.; Gibbs, Iris C.","Deville, Curtiland (Department of Radiation Oncology and Molecular Sciences, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD); Cruickshank, Ian (Howard University School of Medicine, Washington, DC); Chapman, Christina H.

TI represents a potential breakthrough for treating conditions, such as Parkinson's disease and chronic pain. However, early clinical work on TI stimulation was met with mixed outcomes challenging its fundamental mechanisms and applications. Here, we apply established physics to study the mechanisms of TI with the goal of optimizing it for clinical use. We argue that TI stimulation cannot work via passive membrane filtering, as previously hypothesized. Instead, TI stimulation requires an ion-channel mediated signal rectification process. Unfortunately, this mechanism is also responsible for high-frequency conduction block in off-target tissues, thus challenging clinical applications of TI. In consequence, we propose a set of experimental controls that should be performed in future experiments to refine our understanding and practice of TI stimulation. A record of this paper's transparent peer review process is included in the Supplemental Information.","We would like to thank Dr. Esra Neufeld and Dr. Antonino Cassara from the IT IS foundation in Zurich for the useful and enriching discussions on temporal interference.

Based on the diverse experiences of 20 ITD institutional leaders and specific case studies, this article distills key lessons learned from multiple pathways to building successful programs. The lessons reflect both the successes and failures our group has experienced, to suggest how to cultivate appropriate and effective leadership, and generate the resources necessary for leading ITD programs. We present two contrasting pathways toward ITD organizations: one is to establish a new organization and the other is to merge existing organizations. We illustrate how both benefit from a real-world focus, with multiple examples of trajectories of ITD organizations. Our diverse international experiences demonstrate ways to cultivate appropriate leadership qualities and skills, especially the ability to create and foster vision beyond the status quo; collaborative leadership and partnerships; shared culture; communications to multiple audiences; appropriate monitoring and evaluation; and perseverance. We identified five kinds of resources for success: (1) intellectual resources; (2) institutional policies; (3) financial resources; (4) physical infrastructure; and (5) governing boards. We provide illustrations based on our extensive experience in supporting success and learning from failure, and provide a framework that articulates the major facets of leadership in inter- and trans-disciplinary organizations: learning, supporting, sharing, and training.","This work was supported by the National Socio-Environmental Synthesis Center (SESYNC) under funding received from the National Science Foundation DBI-1639145.

Hence, these therapies are an important adjunctive therapy in cancer care.

Measuring human perceptual ability in this context presents a unique challenge, since the stimulus of metabolic rate is not directly controllable. In this paper we introduce and compare two methods for addressing indirect stimuli: conventional method of constant stimuli (MOCS) with binning, and single presentation (SP). Both methods are based on a maximum likelihood estimation for a sigmoidal psychometric curve, under the assumption of a constant Weber fraction. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we conclude that while conventional MOCS with binning performs better for low actuation noise levels, single presentation strategies are better otherwise. We additionally present a pilot result for one subject using the single presentation strategy, which quantified the Just Noticeable Difference (JND) of changes to metabolic rate of 25.2 ±23.2%.",,,2020 8th IEEE RAS/EMBS International Conference for Biomedical Robotics and Biomechatronics (BioRob),,2020-11,2020,00,,483-490,Closed,Proceeding,"Medrano, Roberto L.; Thomas, Gray C.; Rouse, Elliott","Medrano, Roberto L.

We argue that this process is moderated by Bicultural Identity Integration (BII), or individual differences in perceived conflict between two cultural identities. Two quasi-experiments examined biculturals’ preferences for two competing groups, each representing one of their cultural identities, in response to cultural primes. In Study 1, we found that Flemish-Belgian biculturals with low BII, or those who perceive their cultural identities as conflicting, favored the primed cultural group less than the unprimed cultural group. In Study 2, we found the same effect among Asian-American biculturals, but only when the cultural primes were positive. These findings show that low BIIs exhibit psychological reactance to cultural primes that are seen as threatening to the self, which in turn affect their loyalties to competing cultural ingroups.",,International Journal of Intercultural Relations,,,2020-11,2020,,,,Closed,Article,"Cheng, Chi-Ying; Hanek, Kathrin J.; Odom, Annick C.; Lee, Fiona","Cheng, Chi-Ying (School of Social Sciences, Singapore Management University, Singapore); Hanek, Kathrin J.

As the clinical and epidemiological features of COVID-19 have many parallels with influenza, it is important to ensure optimal management of both respiratory diseases as we anticipate their continued co-circulation. In particular, there is a need to ensure that effective surveillance and diagnostic capacities are in place to monitor these and other respiratory viruses, as this will underpin decisions on the appropriate clinical management of the respective diseases. As such, we propose a series of key recommendations for stakeholders, public health authorities, primary care physicians and surveillance bodies that will help mitigate the combined risks of concurrent influenza epidemics and the COVID-19 pandemic. We advocate the judicious use of influenza vaccines and antivirals, particularly among groups at high risk of complications, with healthcare workers also considered a priority for vaccination. It is likely that the increased use of emerging technologies such as telemedicine and contact tracing will permanently change our approach to managing infectious disease. The use of these technologies, alongside existing pharmaceutical strategies, will ensure that we achieve a holistic approach to the global public health measures needed to deal with the combined threat of influenza and COVID-19. Ensuring that this approach is optimal will be key as we move from a reactive pandemic response towards preparing for the long-term management of the remarkable clinical burden associated with these respiratory pathogens.","We would like to thank Maria Zambon for useful discussions and critical reading of the manuscript.

During the pandemic, treatment delay is being recommended in a nonquantitative, nonobjective, and nonpersonalized manner, and this approach may be associated with suboptimal outcomes. Quantitative integration of cancer mortality estimates and data on the consequences of treatment delay is needed to aid treatment decisions and improve patient outcomes. Objective: To obtain quantitative integration of cancer-specific and COVID-19-specific mortality estimates that can be used to make optimal decisions for individual patients and optimize resource allocation. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this decision analytical model, age-specific and stage-specific estimates of overall survival pre-COVID-19 were adjusted by the probability of COVID-19 (individualized by county, treatment-specific variables, hospital exposure frequency, and COVID-19 infectivity estimates), COVID-19 mortality (individualized by age-specific, comorbidity-specific, and treatment-specific variables), and delay of cancer treatment (impact and duration). These model estimates were integrated into a web application (OncCOVID) to calculate estimates of the cumulative overall survival and restricted mean survival time of patients who received immediate vs delayed cancer treatment. Using currently available information about COVID-19, a susceptible-infected-recovered model that accounted for the increased risk among patients at health care treatment centers was developed. This model integrated the data on cancer mortality and the consequences of treatment delay to aid treatment decisions. Age-specific and cancer stage-specific estimates of overall survival pre-COVID-19 were extracted from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database for 691 854 individuals with 25 cancer types who received cancer diagnoses in 2005 to 2006. Data from 5 436 896 individuals in the National Cancer Database were used to estimate the independent impact of treatment delay by cancer type and stage. In addition, data from 275 patients in a nested case-control study were used to estimate the COVID-19 mortality rate by age group and number of comorbidities. Data were analyzed from March 17 to May 21, 2020. Exposures: COVID-19 and cancer. Main Outcomes and Measures: Estimates of restricted mean survival time after the receipt of immediate vs delayed cancer treatment. Results: At the time of the study, the OncCOVID web application allowed for the selection of up to 47 individualized variables to assess net survival for an individual patient with cancer. Substantial heterogeneity was found regarding the association between delayed cancer treatment and net survival among patients with a given cancer type and stage, and these 2 variables were insufficient to discriminate the net impact of immediate vs delayed treatment. Individualized overall survival estimates were associated with patient age, number of comorbidities, treatment received, and specific local community estimates of COVID-19 risk. Conclusions and Relevance: This decision analytical modeling study found that the OncCOVID web-based application can quantitatively aid in the resource allocation of individualized treatment for patients with cancer during the COVID-19 global pandemic.",,JAMA Oncology,,,2020-10-29,2020,6,12,,All OA; Gold,Article,"Hartman, Holly E.; Sun, Yilun; Devasia, Theresa P.; Chase, Elizabeth C.; Jairath, Neil K.; Dess, Robert T.; Jackson, William C.; Morris, Emily; Li, Pin; Hochstedler, Kimberly A.; Abbott, Madeline R.; Kidwell, Kelley M.; Walter, Vonn; Wang, Ming; Wang, Xi; Zaorsky, Nicholas G.; Schipper, Matthew J.; Spratt, Daniel E.","Hartman, Holly E.

In particular, heat decontamination is a treatment method that scales well and can be implemented in settings with variable or limited resources. Prior studies using multiple inactivation methods, however, have often focused on a single virus under narrowly defined conditions, making it difficult to develop guiding principles for inactivating emerging or difficult-to-culture viruses. We systematically explored how temperature, humidity, and virus deposition solutions impact the inactivation of viruses deposited and dried on N95 respirator coupons. We exposed four virus surrogates across a range of structures and phylogenies, including two bacteriophages (MS2 and phi6), a mouse coronavirus (murine hepatitis virus [MHV]), and a recombinant human influenza A virus subtype H3N2 (IAV), to heat treatment for 30 min in multiple deposition solutions across several temperatures and relative humidities (RHs). We observed that elevated RH was essential for effective heat inactivation of all four viruses tested. For heat treatments between 72°C and 82°C, RHs greater than 50% resulted in a >6-log10 inactivation of bacteriophages, and RHs greater than 25% resulted in a >3.5-log10 inactivation of MHV and IAV. Furthermore, deposition of viruses in host cell culture media greatly enhanced virus inactivation by heat and humidity compared to other deposition solutions, such as phosphate-buffered saline, phosphate-buffered saline with bovine serum albumin, and human saliva. Past and future heat treatment methods must therefore explicitly account for deposition solutions as a factor that will strongly influence observed virus inactivation rates. Overall, our data set can inform the design and validation of effective heat-based decontamination strategies for N95 respirators and other porous surfaces, especially for emerging viruses that may be of immediate and future public health concern.IMPORTANCE Shortages of personal protective equipment, including N95 respirators, during the coronavirus (CoV) disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic have highlighted the need to develop effective decontamination strategies for their reuse. This is particularly important in health care settings for reducing exposure to respiratory viruses, like severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes COVID-19. Although several treatment methods are available, a widely accessible strategy will be necessary to combat shortages on a global scale. We demonstrate that the combination of heat and humidity inactivates a range of RNA viruses, including both viral pathogens and common viral pathogen surrogates, after deposition on N95 respirators and achieves the necessary virus inactivation detailed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration guidelines to validate N95 respirator decontamination technologies. We further demonstrate that depositing viruses onto surfaces when suspended in culture media can greatly enhance observed inactivation, adding caution to how heat and humidity treatment methods are validated.","ACKNOWLEDGMENTS We thank Brittany Hicks for assistance preparing materials and Brad Angelocci, Curt Cooper, Patrick McNally, Ken Arnett, and Bryan Shores for their generous support with the humidity chamber.

For those who recover, post-COVID-19 complications may include development of pulmonary fibrosis. Factors contributing to disease severity or development of complications is not known. Using computational analysis with experimental data, we report that IPF and COPD-derived lung fibroblasts express higher levels of ACE2, the receptor for SARS-CoV-2 entry and part of the renin-angiotensin system that is anti-fibrotic and anti-inflammatory. In preclinical models, we found that chronic exposure to cigarette smoke, a risk factor for both COPD and IPF and potentially for SARS-CoV-2 infection, significantly increased pulmonary ACE2 protein expression. Further studies are needed to understand the functional implications of ACE2 on lung fibroblasts, a cell type that thus far as received relatively little attention in the context of COVID-19.",,American Journal of Physiology - Lung Cellular and Molecular Physiology,,,2020-10-28,2020,,,,Closed,Article,"Aloufi, Noof; Traboulsi, Hussein; Ding, Jun; Fonseca, Gregory J; Nair, Parameswaran; Huang, Steven K.; Hussain, Sabah N.

Our recent findings indicate that SQSTM1/p62 (sequestosome 1), a well-known macroautophagy/autophagy receptor, is a lethal inflammatory mediator of sepsis and septic shock. The release of SQSTM1 occurs during tissue damage or microbial invasion through two main ways: one is passive and the other is active. Passive release occurs in the context of GSDMD-mediated pyroptosis. Active SQSTM1 secretion requires two basic steps: the first step is the expression and phosphorylation of SQSTM1 mediated by STING1/STING/TMEM173, and then the unconventional secretion of SQSTM1 by secretory lysosomes. After release, the extracellular SQSTM1 binds to membrane receptor INSR to activate glycolysis, leading to subsequent production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in a transcription factor NFKB-dependent manner. Functionally, genetic deletion or pharmacological inhibition of the SQSTM1-INSR pathway limits tissue damage, systemic inflammation, organ failure, and death in experimental sepsis models in mice. Moreover, the activation of the SQSTM1-INSR pathway is related to the severity of sepsis in patients. These findings highlight a pathological role of extracellular SQSTM1 in infection, inflammation, and immunity.",No potential conflicts of interest were disclosed.,Autophagy,,,2020-10-28,2020,,,,Closed,Article,"Zou, Borong; Liu, Jiao; Klionsky, Daniel J; Tang, Daolin; Kang, Rui","Zou, Borong (The Third Affiliated Hospital, Guangzhou Medical University , Guangzhou, Guangdong, 510510, China.); Liu, Jiao (The Third Affiliated Hospital, Guangzhou Medical University , Guangzhou, Guangdong, 510510, China.); Klionsky, Daniel J (Life Sciences Institute and Department of Molecular, Cellular and Developmental Biology, University of Michigan , Ann Arbor, MI 48109, USA.); Tang, Daolin (The Third Affiliated Hospital, Guangzhou Medical University , Guangzhou, Guangdong, 510510, China.; Department of Surgery, The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center , Dallas, TX 75390, USA.); Kang, Rui (Department of Surgery, The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center , Dallas, TX 75390, USA.)",,"Zou, Borong (Third Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University); Liu, Jiao (Third Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University); Klionsky, Daniel J (University of Michigan); Tang, Daolin (Third Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University; The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center); Kang, Rui (The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center)",University of Michigan; Third Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University; The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center,grid.214458.e; grid.417009.b; grid.267313.2,United States; China; United States,National Institute of General Medical Sciences,0,0,,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1132069701,0601 Biochemistry and Cell Biology; 06 Biological Sciences,
3,pub.1132164309,10.1101/2020.10.27.355479,,,Predictive modeling of virus inactivation by UV,"Abstract  Disinfection strategies are commonly applied to inactivate pathogenic viruses in water, food, air, and on surfaces to prevent the spread of infectious diseases. Determining how quickly viruses are inactivated to mitigate health risks is not always feasible due to biosafety restrictions or difficulties with virus culturability. Therefore, methods that would rapidly predict kinetics of virus inactivation by UV 254 would be valuable, particularly for emerging and difficult-to-culture viruses. We conducted a rapid systematic literature review to collect high-quality inactivation rate constants for a wide range of viruses. Using these data and basic virus information (e.g., genome sequence attributes), we developed and evaluated four different model classes, including linear and non-linear approaches, to find the top performing prediction model. For both the (+) ssRNA and dsDNA virus types, multiple linear regressions were the top performing model classes. In both cases, the cross-validated root mean squared relative prediction errors were similar to those associated with experimental rate constants. We tested the models by predicting and measuring inactivation rate constants for two viruses that were not identified in our systematic review, including a (+) ssRNA mouse coronavirus and a dsDNA marine bacteriophage; the predicted rate constants were within 7% and 71% of the experimental rate constants, respectively. Finally, we applied our models to predict the UV 254 rate constants of several viruses for which high-quality UV 254 inactivation data are not available. Our models will be valuable for predicting inactivation kinetics of emerging or difficult-to-culture viruses.",This work was supported by the Water Research Foundation (WRRF #15-07). Nicole C.

Student engagement is emphasized through providing synchronous and highly interactive virtual learning sessions. This approach not only improves student outcomes related to class, but also is related to strong student mental health. Technological considerations are explored surrounding how to select a video conferencing platform that will enable engagement. Key functionality recommended includes the ability to share audio and video of both instructor and students, virtual hand raising and other signaling capabilities, hosting of small group discussions within the larger class, concurrent chat capabilities, and the crowd‐sourcing of questions. The implications of this functionality from a learning perspective are discussed. Empathy and flexibility in accommodating diverse and evolving student scenarios is also discussed. The importance of setting norms and expectations provides a foundation for the class, both during class sessions as well as in providing a framework within which students conceptualize group work.

To understand the relation between cognition and brain injury, we investigated the effects of concussion on attentional networks using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). Materials & methods: Healthy controls and concussed patients, tested within 72 h from injury (T1) and after symptoms resolved (T2) completed a computerized attention task during fNIRS imaging. Results: T1 patients exhibited slower reaction times and reduced brain activation pattern relative to healthy controls. Interestingly, the cortical oxygenation hemoglobin response at T2 was greater relative to T1 and healthy controls, while reaction time was normative. Conclusion: The exploratory findings of this study suggest once asymptomatic, a compensatory hemodynamic response may support the restoration of reaction time despite ongoing physiological recovery.","University of Michigan Exercise &amp; Sport Science Initiative.

We aimed to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to further explore the incidence AMI in these patients. Methods: We comprehensively searched the MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane databases from their inception to August 2020. The included studies were prospective or retrospective cohort studies that reported the event rate of AMI in COVID-19 patients. Data from each study were combined using random-effects to calculate the pooled incidence with 95% confidence intervals. Results: We identified twenty-seven studies consisting of 8971 hospitalized COVID-19-infected patients. The study demonstrated that 20.0% (95% CI 16.1-23.8% with substantial heterogeneity (I2 = 94.9%)) of hospitalized COVID-19 patients had AMI. In addition, our meta-regression suggested that older age, male and comorbidities were associated with a higher risk of AMI. Conclusion: The incidence of COVID-19-related myocardial injury ranges from 16.1-23.8%.

OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate the feasibility, reliability, and value of remote visits in a phase III clinical trial of individuals with Parkinson's disease. METHODS: We invited individuals with Parkinson's disease enrolled in a phase III clinical trial (STEADY-PD III) to enroll in a sub-study of remote video-based visits. Participants completed three remote visits over one year within four weeks of an in-person visit and completed assessments performed during the remote visit. We evaluated the ability to complete scheduled assessments remotely; agreement between remote and in-person outcome measures; and opinions of remote visits. RESULTS: We enrolled 40 participants (mean (SD) age 64.3 (10.4), 29% women), and 38 (95%) completed all remote visits. There was excellent correlation (ICC 0.81-0.87) between remote and in-person patient-reported outcomes, and moderate correlation (ICC 0.43-0.51) between remote and in-person motor assessments. On average, remote visits took around one quarter of the time of in-person visits (54 vs 190 minutes). Nearly all participants liked remote visits, and three-quarters said they would be more likely to participate in future trials if some visits could be conducted remotely. CONCLUSION: Remote visits are feasible and reliable in a phase III clinical trial of individuals with early, untreated Parkinson's disease. These visits are shorter, reduce participant burden, and enable safe conduct of research visits, which is especially important in the COVID-19 pandemic.",,Journal of Parkinson's Disease,,,2020-10-27,2020,10,4,1779-1786,Closed,Article,"Tarolli, Christopher G; Andrzejewski, Kelly; Zimmerman, Grace A; Bull, Michael; Goldenthal, Steven; Auinger, Peggy; O'Brien, Michael; Dorsey, E Ray; Biglan, Kevin; Simuni, Tanya","Tarolli, Christopher G (Department of Neurology, University of Rochester, Rochester, NY, USA.; Center for Health+Technology, University of Rochester, Rochester, NY.); Andrzejewski, Kelly (Department of Neurology, University at Buffalo, Buffalo, NY, USA.); Zimmerman, Grace A (Department of Neurology, University of Rochester, Rochester, NY, USA.); Bull, Michael (Department of Neurology, University of Rochester, Rochester, NY, USA.); Goldenthal, Steven (Center for Health+Technology, University of Rochester, Rochester, NY.; University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.); Auinger, Peggy (Center for Health+Technology, University of Rochester, Rochester, NY.); O'Brien, Michael (AMC Health, New York, NY, USA.); Dorsey, E Ray (Department of Neurology, University of Rochester, Rochester, NY, USA.; Center for Health+Technology, University of Rochester, Rochester, NY.); Biglan, Kevin (Early Phase Clinical Development, Eli Lilly and Company, Indianapolis, IN, USA.); Simuni, Tanya (Department of Neurology, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, IL, USA.)",,"Tarolli, Christopher G (University of Rochester Medical Center; University of Rochester); Andrzejewski, Kelly (University at Buffalo, State University of New York); Zimmerman, Grace A (University of Rochester Medical Center); Bull, Michael (University of Rochester Medical Center); Goldenthal, Steven (University of Rochester; University of Michigan); Auinger, Peggy (University of Rochester); O'Brien, Michael (Animal Medical Center); Dorsey, E Ray (University of Rochester Medical Center; University of Rochester); Biglan, Kevin (Eli Lilly (United States)); Simuni, Tanya (Northwestern University)","Northwestern University; Eli Lilly (United States); University of Rochester; University of Rochester Medical Center; Animal Medical Center; University of Michigan; University at Buffalo, State University of New York",grid.16753.36; grid.417540.3; grid.16416.34; grid.412750.5; grid.413777.1; grid.214458.e; grid.273335.3,United States; United States; United States; United States; United States; United States; United States,National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke,0,0,,,5,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1130630441,11 Medical and Health Sciences; 1103 Clinical Sciences,

METHODS: The American College of Rheumatology (ACR) created the Workforce Study Group (WSG) to study the rheumatology workforce. The WSG used primary and secondary data to create a representative workforce model. Pediatric rheumatology supply and demand was projected through 2030 using an integrated data-driven framework to capture a more realistic clinical full-time equivalent (FTE) and produce a better picture of access to care issues in pediatric rheumatology. RESULTS: The 2015 pediatric workforce was estimated at 287 FTE (300 providers), while the estimated excess demand was 95 (33%). The projected demand will continue to increase to almost 100% (N=230) by 2030 if no changes occur in succession planning, new graduate entrants into the profession, and other factors associated with the workforce. CONCLUSION: This study projects that the pediatric rheumatology workforce gap will continue to worsen significantly from the 2015 baseline, and by 2030 the demand for pediatric rheumatologists will be twice the supply. Innovative strategies are needed to increase the workforce supply and to improve access to care.",,Arthritis Care & Research,,,2020-10-27,2020,,,,Closed,Article,"Correll, Colleen K.; Ditmyer, Marcia M.; Mehta, Jay; Imundo, Lisa F.; Klein‐Gitelman, Marisa S.; Monrad, Seetha U.; Battafarano, Daniel F.","Correll, Colleen K.

LORs (n = 487) written for applicants (n = 125) invited to interview at a single RO residency program from the 2015 to 2019 application cycles were included for analysis. Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) software was used to evaluate LORs for length and a dictionary of predetermined themes. Language was evaluated for gender bias using a publicly available gender bias calculator. Non-parametric tests were used to compare linguistic domain scores. The median number of the LORs per applicant was 4 (range 3-5). No significant differences by applicant gender were detected in LIWC score domains or gender bias calculator (P > 0.05). However, LORs for applicants from racial/ethnic backgrounds underrepresented in medicine were less likely to include standout descriptors (P = 0.008). Male writers were less likely to describe applicant characteristics related to patient care (P < 0.0001) and agentic personality (P = 0.006). LORs written by RO were shorter (P < 0.0001) and included fewer standout descriptors (P = 0.014) but were also more likely to include statements regarding applicant desirability (P = 0.045) and research (P = 0.008). While language was globally male-biased, assistant professors were less likely than associate professors (P = 0.0064) and full professors (P = 0.023) to use male-biased language. Significant linguistic differences were observed in RO residency LORs, suggesting that implicit biases related to both applicants and letter writers may exist.

The importance of vaccines cannot be overstated during the outbreak of a pandemic, such as the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The understanding of genomics, structural biology, and innate/adaptive immunity have expanded the toolkits available for current vaccine development. However, sudden outbreaks and the requirement of population-level immunization still pose great challenges in today's vaccine designs. Well-established vaccine development protocols from previous experiences are in place to guide the pipelines of vaccine development for emerging viral diseases. Nevertheless, vaccine development may follow different paradigms during a pandemic. For example, multiple vaccine candidates must be pushed into clinical trials simultaneously, and manufacturing capability must be scaled up in early stages. Factors from essential features of safety, efficacy, manufacturing, and distributions to administration approaches are taken into consideration based on advances in materials science and engineering technologies. In this review, we present recent advances in vaccine development by focusing on vaccine discovery, formulation, and delivery devices enabled by alternative administration approaches. We hope to shed light on developing better solutions for faster and better vaccine development strategies through the use of biomaterials, biomolecular engineering, nanotechnology, and microfabrication techniques.","Acknowledgments This work was supported by National Institute of Health (CA214411, GM126831, and AR069564).",ACS Nano,,,2020-10-27,2020,14,10,12370-12389,All OA;

Establishing effective methods to concentrate and purify viral genomes prior to sequencing is essential for high quality viromes. Using virus spike-and-recovery experiments, we stepwise compared two common approaches for virus concentration, ultrafiltration and iron chloride flocculation, across diverse matrices: wastewater influent, wastewater secondary effluent, river water, and seawater. Viral DNA was purified by removing cellular DNA via chloroform cell lysis, filtration, and enzymatic degradation of extra-viral DNA. We found that viral genomes were concentrated 1-2 orders of magnitude more with ultrafiltration than iron chloride flocculation for all matrices and resulted in higher quality DNA suitable for amplification-free and long-read sequencing. Given its widespread use and utility as an inexpensive field method for virome sampling, we nonetheless sought to optimize iron flocculation. We found viruses were best concentrated in seawater with 5-fold higher iron concentrations than the standard used, inhibition of DNase activity reduced purification effectiveness, and five-fold more iron was needed to flocculate viruses from freshwater than seawater—critical knowledge for those seeking to apply this broadly used method to freshwater virome samples. Overall, our results demonstrated that ultrafiltration and purification performed better than iron chloride flocculation and purification in the tested matrices. Given that the method performance depended on the solids content and salinity of the samples, we suggest spike-and-recovery experiments be applied when concentrating and purifying sample types that diverge from those tested here.  Importance Viruses in diverse habitats numerically dominate microbial community members and are consequential for host fate and responsible for disease outbreaks. Metagenomics has provided novel insights into their presence, diversity, and ecosystem impacts. Yet the approach is hindered by the challenge that, despite their numbers, viral genomes comprise a minor portion of total community DNA in a sample. To comprehensively describe a viral community with metagenomics, viral genomes must be effectively concentrated and purified to capture low abundance and rare viruses amidst the overwhelming presence of cellular genomic DNA. We evaluated two commonly applied methods for concentrating and purifying viral DNA, ultrafiltration and iron chloride flocculation, across four aquatic sample types that differ in their solids content and salinity. Our findings demonstrated the importance of sample characteristics for method effectivity and provided performance measures for a variety of matrices. These findings contribute a more comprehensive understanding of the impacts of virome sample preparation across diverse matrices and are thus important for guiding future virome studies, given the wide range of habitats in which viruses are studied.","We would like to thank Ariel Roy and Michael Mata for helping process influent and secondary effluent jar tests.

During the current COVID-19 pandemic, social distancing guidelines require alternative data collection in order to protect both research staff and participants. Home-collected respiratory specimens are less resource-intensive, can be collected earlier after symptom onset, and provide a low-contact means of data collection. A prospective, multi-year, community-based cohort study is an ideal setting to examine the utility of home-collected specimens for identification of influenza. METHODS: We describe the feasibility and reliability of home-collected specimens for the detection of influenza. We collected data and specimens between October 2014 and June 2017 from the Household Influenza Vaccine Evaluation (HIVE) Study. Cohort participants were asked to collect a nasal swab at home upon onset of acute respiratory illness. Research staff also collected nose and throat swab specimens in the study clinic within 7 days of onset. We estimated agreement using Cohen's kappa and calculated sensitivity and specificity of home-collected compared to staff-collected specimens. RESULTS: We tested 336 paired staff- and home-collected respiratory specimens for influenza by RT-PCR; 150 staff-collected specimens were positive for influenza A/H3N2, 23 for influenza A/H1N1, 14 for influenza B/Victoria, and 31 for influenza B/Yamagata. We found moderate agreement between collection methods for influenza A/H3N2 (0.70) and B/Yamagata (0.69) and high agreement for influenza A/H1N1 (0.87) and B/Victoria (0.86). Sensitivity ranged from 78% to 86% for all influenza types and subtypes. Specificity was high for influenza A/H1N1 and both influenza B lineages with a range from 96% to 100%, and slightly lower for A/H3N2 infections (88%). CONCLUSIONS: Collection of nasal swab specimens at home is both feasible and reliable for identification of influenza virus infections.","The authors wish to thank the HIVE Study participants for their participation in this research, as well as the HIVE Study staff for their hard work and dedication to the project.",Influenza and Other Respiratory Viruses,,,2020-10-26,2020,,,,All OA; Gold,Article,"Malosh, Ryan E.; Petrie, Joshua G.; Callear, Amy P.; Monto, Arnold S.; Martin, Emily T.","Malosh, Ryan E.

Since the COVID-19 pandemic began, resulting in suspension of many clinical preventive services, pediatric vaccination rates in the United States have fallen precipitously, dramatically increasing risk of measles resurgence. Previous research has shown that measles outbreaks in high-coverage contexts are driven by spatial clustering of nonvaccination, which decreases local immunity below the herd immunity threshold. However, little is known about how to best conduct surveillance and target interventions to detect and address these high-risk areas, and most vaccination data are reported at the state-level-a resolution too coarse to detect community-level clustering of nonvaccination characteristic of recent outbreaks. In this paper, we perform a series of computational experiments to assess the impact of clustered nonvaccination on outbreak potential and magnitude of bias in predicting disease risk posed by measuring vaccination rates at coarse spatial scales. We find that, when nonvaccination is locally clustered, reporting aggregate data at the state- or county-level can result in substantial underestimates of outbreak risk. The COVID-19 pandemic has shone a bright light on the weaknesses in US infectious disease surveillance and a broader gap in our understanding of how to best use detailed spatial data to interrupt and control infectious disease transmission. Our research clearly outlines that finer-scale vaccination data should be collected to prevent a return to endemic measles transmission in the United States.",J.Z. was supported by a Catalyst award from the Michigan Institute of Computational Discovery and Engineering and a Michigan Institute for Clinical and Health Research Pathway Award.

For example, tactile data representations are commonly used by BVI people to explore spatial graphics, but it is difficult for BVI people to construct and understand tactile representations without prior training or expert assistance. In this work, we adopt a constructive visualization framework of using simple and versatile tokens to engage non-experts in the construction of tactile data representations. We present preliminary results of how participants chose to interpret and create tactile data representations and the preferred haptic exploratory procedures used for retrieving information.

Participant characteristics have been shown to affect engagement with these programs; however, limited information is available about the relationship between participant characteristics and engagement with internet-based programs for self-management of chronic pain. The current study examined relationships between demographic and clinical characteristics and engagement with the Pain EASE program, a self-directed, internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy intervention for veterans with chronic low back pain (cLBP). Veterans with cLBP were enrolled in a 10 week trial of the Pain EASE program. Engagement measures included the number of logins, access to coping skill modules, and completed study staff-initiated weekly check-in calls. Regression analyses were conducted to identify significant predictors of engagement from hypothesized predictors (e.g., race/ethnicity, age, depressive symptom severity, and pain interference). Participants (N = 58) were 93% male, 60.3% identified as White, and had a mean age of 54.5 years. Participants logged into the program a median of 3.5 times, accessed a median of 2 skill modules, and attended a median of 6 check-in calls. Quantile regression revealed that, at the 50th percentile, non-White-identified participants accessed fewer modules than White-identified participants (p = .019). Increased age was associated with increased module use (p = .001). No clinical characteristics were significantly associated with engagement measures. White-identified race/ethnicity and increased age were associated with greater engagement with the Pain EASE program. Results highlight the importance of defining and increasing engagement in internet-delivered pain care.",Funding: This study was funded by a Veterans Health Administration Rehabilitation Research and Development Service Investigator Initiated Research Award (RX000998-03),Translational Behavioral Medicine,,,2020-10-24,2020,,,ibaa098-,All OA; Gold,Article,"Solar, Chelsey; Halat, Allison M; MacLean, R Ross; Rajeevan, Haseena; Williams, David A; Krein, Sarah L; Heapy, Alicia A; Bair, Matthew J; Kerns, Robert D; Higgins, Diana M","Solar, Chelsey (Department of Emergency Medicine, VA Boston Healthcare System, Boston, MA USA); Halat, Allison M (Research Service, VA Boston Healthcare System, Boston, MA, USA); MacLean, R Ross (Department of Psychology, VA Connecticut Healthcare System, West Haven, CT, USA; Department of Psychiatry, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA); Rajeevan, Haseena (Center for Medical Informatics, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA); Williams, David A (Department of Anesthesiology, Chronic Pain and Fatigue Research Center, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI, USA); Krein, Sarah L (VA Ann Arbor Center for Clinical Management Research, Ann Arbor, MI, USA; Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI, USA); Heapy, Alicia A (Department of Psychiatry, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA; Pain, Research, Informatics, Medical comorbidities and Education (PRIME) Center of Innovation, VA Connecticut Healthcare System, West Haven, CT, USA); Bair, Matthew J (Center for Health Information and Communication (CHIC), VA Health Services Research and Development, Indianapolis, IN, USA; Department of Medicine, Indiana University School of Medicine and Regenstrief Institute, Indianapolis, IN, USA); Kerns, Robert D (Departments of Psychiatry, Neurology, and Psychology, Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA); Higgins, Diana M (Anesthesiology, Critical Care, and Pain Medicine Service, VA Boston Healthcare System, Boston, MA, USA; Department of Psychiatry, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, MA, USA)",,"Solar, Chelsey (VA Boston Healthcare System); Halat, Allison M (VA Boston Healthcare System); MacLean, R Ross (VA Connecticut Healthcare System; Yale University); Rajeevan, Haseena (Yale University); Williams, David A (University of Michigan); Krein, Sarah L (University of Michigan); Heapy, Alicia A (Yale University); Bair, Matthew J (Indiana University – Purdue University Indianapolis); Kerns, Robert D (Yale University); Higgins, Diana M (VA Boston Healthcare System; Boston University School of Medicine)",VA Connecticut Healthcare System; Boston University School of Medicine; VA Boston Healthcare System; Yale University; University of Michigan; Indiana University – Purdue University Indianapolis,grid.281208.1; grid.475010.7; grid.410370.1; grid.47100.32; grid.214458.e; grid.257413.6,United States; United States; United States; United States; United States; United States,Rehabilitation Research and Development Service; United States Department of Veterans Affairs,0,0,,,1,https://academic.oup.com/tbm/advance-article-pdf/doi/10.1093/tbm/ibaa098/34002939/ibaa098.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1132030154,1117 Public Health and Health Services; 11 Medical and Health Sciences,

A wave of recent instruments measuring critical consciousness has been rigorously validated. Yet, whether these measures efficiently assess different levels of critical consciousness or contain redundant, or non-informative, items remain unknown. This research develops a short version (Short CCS, or ShoCCS) of the previously validated Critical Consciousness Scale. Using Item Response Theory methods, the long-form CCS is scrutinized for redundant items to efficiently measure critical reflection, critical motivation, and critical action. The resulting 13-item ShoCCS yields an internally consistent instrument with similar information distributions as the longer measure. Since the ShoCCS places less financial and time burden on investigators and respondents in comparison to the original CCS, and includes a new measure of critical motivation, it may streamline CC measurement in scholarship, practice, and policy.",,Applied Developmental Science,,,2020-10-24,2020,,,1-17,All OA; Gold,Article,"Diemer, Matthew A.; Frisby, Michael B.; Pinedo, Andres; Bardelli, Emanuele; Elliot, Erin; Harris, Elise; McAlister, Sara; Voight, Adam M.","Diemer, Matthew A.

10,pub.1131960400,10.3389/fmed.2020.572989,,,Coagulopathy as a Prodrome of Cytokine Storm in COVID-19-Infected Patients,"Background: The rapid coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has hit hard on the world and causes panic since the virus causes serious infectious respiratory illness and easily leads to severe conditions such as immune system overactivation or cytokine storm. Due to the limited knowledge on the course of infection of this coronavirus and the lack of an effective treatment for this fatal disease, mortality remains high. The emergence of a cytokine storm in patients with a severe condition has been reported as the top reason of the death of patients with COVID-19 infection. However, the causative mechanism of cytokine storm remains elusive. Thus, we aim to observe the association of coagulopathy (D-dimer) with cytokine (i.e., IL-6) and CT imaging in COVID-19-infected patients. Methods: In this retrospective observational study, we systematically analyzed the comprehensive clinical laboratory data of COVID-19-positive patients in different illness groups of mild, moderate, and severe conditions according to the Chinese Clinical Guidance for COVID-19 Pneumonia Diagnosis and Treatment (7th edition). T tests and chi-square tests were used for two-group comparisons. One-way ANOVA was used for three-group comparisons. Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficients of the D-dimer level with IL-6 and CT imaging were computed at baseline. With regular liquid biopsy approach, D-dimer, IL-6, and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio were recorded repeatedly with a time curve to investigate disease progression, along with CT imaging, and other indicators. Results: All the 64 patients were clinically evaluated and classified into three groups of mild (32 cases), moderate (23 cases), and severe (nine cases) conditions. The D-dimer level positively correlated with IL-6 (R = 0.5) at baseline when the COVID-19-infected patients were admitted. In addition, we observed that D-dimer rises earlier than the cytokine storm represented by IL-6 surge, which suggests that coagulopathy might act as a trigger to potentiate a cytokine storm. Conclusion: Integrated analysis revealed a positive correlation of coagulopathy with cytokine storm in COVID-19-infected patients; the D-dimer rises early, which indicates that coagulopathy acts as a prodrome of cytokine storm. Coagulopathy can be used to monitor early cytokine storm in COVID-19-infected patients.","YS is supported as a post-doctoral fellow under 5T32CA117865 (V. Champion, PI).

Tocilizumab, a monoclonal antibody against the interleukin 6 receptor, may counteract the inflammatory cytokine release syndrome in patients with severe COVID-19 illness. Objective: To test whether tocilizumab decreases mortality in this population. Design, Setting, and Participants: The data for this study were derived from a multicenter cohort study of 4485 adults with COVID-19 admitted to participating intensive care units (ICUs) at 68 hospitals across the US from March 4 to May 10, 2020. Critically ill adults with COVID-19 were categorized according to whether they received or did not receive tocilizumab in the first 2 days of admission to the ICU. Data were collected retrospectively until June 12, 2020. A Cox regression model with inverse probability weighting was used to adjust for confounding. Exposures: Treatment with tocilizumab in the first 2 days of ICU admission. Main Outcomes and Measures: Time to death, compared via hazard ratios (HRs), and 30-day mortality, compared via risk differences. Results: Among the 3924 patients included in the analysis (2464 male [62.8%]; median age, 62 [interquartile range {IQR}, 52-71] years), 433 (11.0%) received tocilizumab in the first 2 days of ICU admission. Patients treated with tocilizumab were younger (median age, 58 [IQR, 48-65] vs 63 [IQR, 52-72] years) and had a higher prevalence of hypoxemia on ICU admission (205 of 433 [47.3%] vs 1322 of 3491 [37.9%] with mechanical ventilation and a ratio of partial pressure of arterial oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen of <200 mm Hg) than patients not treated with tocilizumab. After applying inverse probability weighting, baseline and severity-of-illness characteristics were well balanced between groups. A total of 1544 patients (39.3%) died, including 125 (28.9%) treated with tocilizumab and 1419 (40.6%) not treated with tocilizumab. In the primary analysis, during a median follow-up of 27 (IQR, 14-37) days, patients treated with tocilizumab had a lower risk of death compared with those not treated with tocilizumab (HR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.56-0.92). The estimated 30-day mortality was 27.5% (95% CI, 21.2%-33.8%) in the tocilizumab-treated patients and 37.1% (95% CI, 35.5%-38.7%) in the non-tocilizumab-treated patients (risk difference, 9.6%; 95% CI, 3.1%-16.0%). Conclusions and Relevance: Among critically ill patients with COVID-19 in this cohort study, the risk of in-hospital mortality in this study was lower in patients treated with tocilizumab in the first 2 days of ICU admission compared with patients whose treatment did not include early use of tocilizumab. However, the findings may be susceptible to unmeasured confounding, and further research from randomized clinical trials is needed.",,JAMA Internal Medicine,,,2020-10-20,2020,181,1,,All OA; Gold,Article,"Gupta, Shruti; Wang, Wei; Hayek, Salim S.; Chan, Lili; Mathews, Kusum S.; Melamed, Michal L.; Brenner, Samantha K.; Leonberg-Yoo, Amanda; Schenck, Edward J.; Radbel, Jared; Reiser, Jochen; Bansal, Anip; Srivastava, Anand; Zhou, Yan; Finkel, Diana; Green, Adam; Mallappallil, Mary; Faugno, Anthony J.; Zhang, Jingjing; Velez, Juan Carlos Q.; Shaefi, Shahzad; Parikh, Chirag R.; Charytan, David M.; Athavale, Ambarish M.; Friedman, Allon N.; Redfern, Roberta E.; Short, Samuel A.

In this paper we discuss five questions that the Lifespan ERI Study Group grappled with in our effort propose a lifespan model of ERI: (1) When does ERI development begin and end? (2) How do we account for age-dependent and contextually-initiated factors in ERI? (3) Should there be a reference point for healthy ERI, and if so, what is it? (4) How do the multiplicities of identity (intersectionality, multiracialism, whiteness) figure into our conceptualization of ERI? (5) How do we understand the role of ERI in pursuit of equity, diversity, and social justice? We note that these are persistent questions in ERI research, and thus our goal is to present our collective reckoning with these issues as well as our ponderings about why they persist.

We present an investigation into theaters' strategies of 1) attracting existing patrons, 2) encouraging commitment, and 3) fostering contribution in an unforeseen public health crisis where face-to-face interactions are no longer possible.

Marginalized communities such as those from Black and Hispanic origins face disproportionate chronic illness because of racial and other underlying disparities.

While video visits have certain advantages, such as the ability to see the children in their home, they also have potential drawbacks, as some exam maneuvers and objective measurement tools cannot be performed virtually. The increased utilization of telemedicine also raises questions about access to care. Video visits can remove the transportation and time barriers that some families face. However, they raise new barriers, such as a requirement for home internet access and insurance coverage, that may negatively impact access to care for certain patients. Moving forward, a combination of clinic and video visits in pediatric rehabilitation may be the best way to harness the advantages of both modalities while minimizing their disadvantages.

RECENT FINDINGS: While living with food insecurity impacts stress and diet-related behaviors in children and adolescents, it is not clear whether food insecurity is associated with obesity above and beyond the influence of poverty. However, strategies to mitigate food insecurity and obesity are inherently connected, and recent examples from clinical practice (e.g., screening for food insecurity among patients) and advocacy (e.g., policy considerations regarding federal food programs such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP) are discussed. Food insecurity and obesity coexist in low-income children and adolescents in the USA.

4,pub.1131847135,10.1681/asn.2020060897,33067383,,AKI Treated with Renal Replacement Therapy in Critically Ill Patients with COVID-19.,"BACKGROUND: AKI is a common sequela of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, few studies have focused on AKI treated with RRT (AKI-RRT). METHODS: We conducted a multicenter cohort study of 3099 critically ill adults with COVID-19 admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) at 67 hospitals across the United States. We used multivariable logistic regression to identify patient-and hospital-level risk factors for AKI-RRT and to examine risk factors for 28-day mortality among such patients. RESULTS: A total of 637 of 3099 patients (20.6%) developed AKI-RRT within 14 days of ICU admission, 350 of whom (54.9%) died within 28 days of ICU admission. Patient-level risk factors for AKI-RRT included CKD, men, non-White race, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, higher body mass index, higher d-dimer, and greater severity of hypoxemia on ICU admission. Predictors of 28-day mortality in patients with AKI-RRT were older age, severe oliguria, and admission to a hospital with fewer ICU beds or one with greater regional density of COVID-19. At the end of a median follow-up of 17 days (range, 1-123 days), 403 of the 637 patients (63.3%) with AKI-RRT had died, 216 (33.9%) were discharged, and 18 (2.8%) remained hospitalized. Of the 216 patients discharged, 73 (33.8%) remained RRT dependent at discharge, and 39 (18.1%) remained RRT dependent 60 days after ICU admission. CONCLUSIONS: AKI-RRT is common among critically ill patients with COVID-19 and is associated with a hospital mortality rate of >60%. Among those who survive to discharge, one in three still depends on RRT at discharge, and one in six remains RRT dependent 60 days after ICU admission.",,Journal of the American Society of Nephrology,,,2020-10-16,2020,,,asn.2020060897,Closed,Article,"Gupta, Shruti; Coca, Steven G; Chan, Lili; Melamed, Michal L; Brenner, Samantha K; Hayek, Salim S; Sutherland, Anne; Puri, Sonika; Srivastava, Anand; Leonberg-Yoo, Amanda; Shehata, Alexandre M; Flythe, Jennifer E; Rashidi, Arash; Schenck, Edward J; Goyal, Nitender; Hedayati, S Susan; Dy, Rajany; Bansal, Anip; Athavale, Ambarish; Nguyen, H Bryant; Vijayan, Anitha; Charytan, David M; Schulze, Carl E; Joo, Min J; Friedman, Allon N; Zhang, Jingjing; Sosa, Marie Anne; Judd, Eric; Velez, Juan Carlos Q; Mallappallil, Mary; Redfern, Roberta E; Bansal, Amar D; Neyra, Javier A; Liu, Kathleen D; Renaghan, Amanda D; Christov, Marta; Molnar, Miklos Z; Sharma, Shreyak; Kamal, Omer; Boateng, Jeffery Owusu; Short, Samuel A P; Admon, Andrew J; Sise, Meghan E; Wang, Wei; Parikh, Chirag R; Leaf, David E","Gupta, Shruti (Division of Renal Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts.); Coca, Steven G (Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York.); Chan, Lili (Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York.); Melamed, Michal L (Department of Medicine, Montefiore Medical Center/Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, New York.); Brenner, Samantha K (Department of Internal Medicine, Hackensack Meridian School of Medicine, Seton Hall, Nutley, New Jersey.; Department of Internal Medicine, Heart and Vascular Hospital, Hackensack Meridian Health Hackensack University Medical Center, Hackensack, New Jersey.); Hayek, Salim S (Division of Cardiology, University of Michigan Medical Center, Ann Arbor, Michigan.); Sutherland, Anne (Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Rutgers New Jersey Medical School, Newark, New Jersey.); Puri, Sonika (Division of Nephrology, Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, New Brunswick, New Jersey.); Srivastava, Anand (Division of Nephrology and Hypertension, Center for Translational Metabolism and Health, Institute for Public Health and Medicine, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, Illinois.); Leonberg-Yoo, Amanda (Renal-Electrolyte and Hypertension Division, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.); Shehata, Alexandre M (Department of Medicine, Hackensack Meridian Health Mountainside Medical Center, Glen Ridge, New Jersey.); Flythe, Jennifer E (Division of Nephrology and Hypertension, Department of Medicine, University of North Carolina Kidney Center, University of North Carolina School of Medicine, Chapel Hill, North Carolina.; Cecil G.

This study was undertaken to evaluate autoantibodies targeting NETs in patients with primary APS, and to determine their potential functions and clinical associations. METHODS: We measured global anti-NET activity in 76 patients with primary APS, 23 patients with systemic lupus erythematosus without antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL), 11 patients with a history of unprovoked venous thrombosis without aPL, and 44 healthy controls. The ability of APS sera to degrade NETs was also assessed. RESULTS: We found markedly elevated levels of anti-NET IgG and IgM in patients with primary APS compared with healthy controls (for IgG, mean ± SD optical density 0.55 ± 0.34 versus 0.33 ± 0.17; for IgM, mean ± SD optical density 0.76 ± 0.51 versus 0.26 ± 0.23). This anti-NET activity did not correlate with levels of traditional aPL and was relatively stable over time. Mechanistically, anti-NET antibodies (especially of the IgG isotype) impaired the ability of patient sera to degrade NETs (r = 0.4, P = 0.003). Levels of anti-NET IgM inversely correlated with complement C4 (r = 0.4, P = 0.019). Clinically, anti-NET antibodies associated with certain APS clinical manifestations, and in particular recurrent venous thrombosis (odds ratio 4.3; P = 0.002). Interestingly, anti-NET antibody levels also appeared to be associated with unprovoked venous thrombosis in the general population (for IgM, mean ± SD optical density 0.67 ± 0.34 versus 0.26 ± 0.23). CONCLUSION: Our data indicate high levels of anti-NET antibodies in patients with primary APS, which may impair NET clearance and activate the complement cascade. These findings may ultimately enable more effective risk stratification.",,Arthritis & Rheumatology,,,2020-10-16,2020,,,,Closed,Article,"Zuo, Yu; Yalavarthi, Srilakshmi; Gockman, Kelsey; Madison, Jacqueline A.; Gudjonsson, Johann E.; Kahlenberg, J.

SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the more lethal but less transmissible coronaviruses SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV. Here, we have carried out comparative viral-human protein-protein interaction and viral protein localization analysis for all three viruses. Subsequent functional genetic screening identified host factors that functionally impinge on coronavirus proliferation, including Tom70, a mitochondrial chaperone protein that interacts with both SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 Orf9b, an interaction we structurally characterized using cryo-EM. Combining genetically-validated host factors with both COVID-19 patient genetic data and medical billing records identified important molecular mechanisms and potential drug treatments that merit further molecular and clinical study.","This research was funded by grants from the National Institutes of Health, NIH (P01AI063302, P50AI150476, R01AI120694, R01AI122747, R01AI143292, U19AI135972 and U19AI135990 to N.J.K.; P01AI120943, R01AI143292 to C.F.B.; U19 AI135990 to T.I.); by National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases R01AI128214 to O.R.; National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke R01 NS089713, the NIH Office of the Director AI150476 and NIGMS R01 GM24485 to R.S.; by a Fast Grant for COVID-19 from the Emergent Ventures program at the Mercatus Center of George Mason University (N.J.K.) and a separate Fast Grant for COVID-19 (C.F.B); by Roddenberry Foundation Gladstone Institutes to K.S.P.; from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (HR0011-19-2-0020 to B.K.S., N.J.K., K.A.V., D.A.A., A.G.-S. and K.M.S.; HR0011-20-2-0040 to M.B.F.); NIGMS R35GM122481 (to B.K.S.); by CRIP (Center for Research for Influenza Pathogenesis), a NIAID supported Center of Excellence for Influenza Research and Surveillance (CEIRS, contract # HHSN272201400008C) to A.G.-S.; by supplements to NIAID grant U19AI135972 and DoD grant W81XWH-20-1-0270 to A.G.-S.; by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (INV-006099) and BARDA (ASPR-20-01495) to M.B.F., by Howard Hughes Medical Institute to K.S.; by Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation DRG-2402-20 to C.P.; by Burroughs Wellcome Fund 1019894 to N.H.; by the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative to O.S. and T.K.; by Cytoscape: A modeling platform for biomolecular networks (NHGRI R01 HG009979) to T.I.; by the generous support of the JPB Foundation, the Open Philanthropy Project (research grant 2020-215611 (5384) and by anonymous donors to A.G.-S.; a Laboratoire d’Excellence grant ANR-10-LABX-62-IBEID and the URGENCE COVID-19 Institut Pasteur fundraising campaign to M.V and N.J.; by grants from the BBSRC (BB/S009566/1 and BB/L002841/1) to A.P. and D.W. and by BBSRC White Rose DTP (BB/J014443/1) to A.S-S.; by The Augusta University-Georgia State University Seed Grant program to C.F.B.; by the MRC grant MC PC 19026 to M.P.; by the MRC Grant MC_UU_12016/2 to D.A.; by the Medical Research Council (MC_UU_12016/2) to D.R.A.; by the DFG under Germany’s Excellence Strategy (EXC-2189, project ID 390939984 to R.G.); and funding from F.

Despite extensive research, only a handful of vaccine adjuvants have been approved for human use. Currently used adjuvants are mostly composed of components that are non-native to the human body, such as aluminum salt, bacterial lipids, or foreign genomic material. Here, a new ionic-liquid-based adjuvant is explored, synthesized using two metabolites of the body, choline and lactic acid (ChoLa). ChoLa distributes the antigen efficiently upon injection, maintains antigen integrity, enhances immune infiltration at the injection site, and leads to a potent immune response against the antigen. Thus, it can serve as a promising safe adjuvant platform that can help to protect against pandemics and future infectious threats.",This work was financially supported by Harvard John. A.

66,pub.1131537808,10.1111/jgs.16869,33034039,,Partnering with Local Hospitals and Public Health to Manage COVID‐19 Outbreaks in Nursing Homes,"OBJECTIVE: Almost half of COVID-19 related deaths in the United States are linked to nursing homes (NHs). We describe among short-term and long-term residents at three NHs in Michigan the outbreak identification process, universal testing, point prevalence of COVID- 19, and subsequent containment efforts, outcomes, and challenges. DESIGN: Outbreak investigation. SETTING: Three NHs in Southeast Michigan. PARTICIPANTS: All residents (N = 215) at three NHs (total beds 356) affiliated with a large academic healthcare system. METHODS: Upon detection of confirmed cases within the facility, each NH in collaboration and consultation with local hospital, public health officials and parent corporation, implemented immediate facility-wide testing and the following intervention measures: cohorting of COVID-19 positive residents; communication regarding testing and results with residents, healthcare professionals, and families; personal protective equipment (PPE) re-education and use throughout facilities; and dedicated staffing for infected patients cohorted in a dedicated COVID-19 wing. We collected patient data regarding demographics, symptoms, comorbidities, hospitalization, and 14-day outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 29 cases of COVID-19 were identified at three participating NHs. Nineteen cases of COVID-19 were identified through symptom-triggered testing from March 23-April 23, 2020; 10 (4.7%) additional cases were identified through universal testing of 215 residents conducted April 7-15, 2020. The hospitalization rate was 37.9%. The case fatality rate was 20.7% (6/29); these cases had multiple comorbidities. No residents who tested positive through the point-prevalence survey required hospitalization, and four were discharged home within fourteen days. CONCLUSIONS: Proactive and coordinated steps are needed between NH medical directors and administrators, referral hospitals and their laboratories, and local public health officials to rapidly respond to an outbreak and limit the transmission of COVID-19. This coordinated approach may be an effective measure to save lives, minimize the burden to the healthcare system, and save healthcare costs. This article is protected by copyright.

Explaining the Scope and Organization of Public Health in the European Union,"Public health is notoriously difficult to define, and that is the case for public health in the European Union as much as other political systems. In this article, the authors try to identify the actual scope and meaning of public health as it is institutionalized in the EU political system. Using a mixture of historical policy and legal analysis, the authors show how the evolution of the institutional space called public health in the EU has been shaped by the EU's distinctive constitutional nature, its focus on regulation, and the legacy of its focus on market making as well as the preferences of its political leaders. The European Union does have an increasingly large space named ""public health,"" in which health ministers, the health directorate-general, and invocation of its public health treaty article 168 can be found, as well as a much broader and older area of activities justified by the need to manage adverse health consequences of market-making policies in other areas such as labor standards and agriculture. The COVID-19 crisis of 2020 not only led to a strengthening of EU public health but also showed that the EU is one of the many political systems in which the legal and bureaucratic domain of public health is far smaller than the actual issues affecting the public's health.",,Journal of Health Politics Policy and Law,,,2020-10-14,2020,,,,All OA; Gold,Article,"Greer, Scott L; Jarman, Holly","Greer, Scott L (University of Michigan.); Jarman, Holly (University of Michigan.)",,"Greer, Scott L (University of Michigan); Jarman, Holly (University of Michigan)",University of Michigan,grid.214458.e,United States,,0,0,,,,https://read.dukeupress.edu/jhppl/article-pdf/doi/10.1215/03616878-8706591/825409/8706591.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1131949603,1606 Political Science; 16 Studies in Human Society,

We suggest the centering of a trauma-informed approach to education and academic administration during the COVID-19 pandemic using the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration’s (SAMHSA) guidance on trauma-informed approaches to care. In our model for trauma-informed education and administration (M-TIEA), SAMHSA’s four key organizational assumptions are foundational, including a realization about trauma and its wide-ranging effects; a recognition of the basic signs and symptoms of trauma; a response that involves fully integrating knowledge into programs, policies, and practices; and an active process for resisting retraumatization. Since educators during the pandemic must follow new restrictions regarding how they teach, we have expanded the practice of teaching in M-TIEA to include both academic administrators’ decision making about teaching, and educators’ planning and implementation of teaching. In M-TIEA, SAMHSA’s six guiding principles for a trauma-informed approach are infused into these two interrelated teaching processes, and include the following: safety; trustworthiness and transparency; peer support; collaboration and mutuality; empowerment, voice, and choice; and cultural, historical, and gender issues. M-TIEA’s organizational assumptions, processes, and principles are situated within an outer context that acknowledges the potential influences of four types of intersectional traumas and stressors that may occur at multiple socioecological levels: pandemic-related trauma and stressors; other forms of individual, group, community, or mass trauma and stressors; historical trauma; and current general life stressors. This acknowledges that all trauma-informed work is dynamic and may be influenced by contextual factors.",,Pedagogy in Health Promotion,,,2020-10-14,2020,,,237337992096559,Closed,Article,"Harper, Gary W.; Neubauer, Leah C.","Harper, Gary W.

It is the most recent of several attempts to expand EU powers over member state policy with the goal of austere budgeting, and one that has led to remarkable claims of authority by the European Union over member state health policies as detailed as medical school admissions and the role of primary care. It is expected that it would be resisted not just by those who object to an EU role in the organization and delivery of health care but also by those who object to a particular austere approach to health policy. How well is it working? Using two waves of interviews and documentary analysis, and health as a policy case study, the authors document three key techniques that opponents use to undermine the semester's governance architecture: broadening goals, expanding the scope of conflict, and disputing and nuancing indicators. The result is that opponents of a narrow fiscal governance agenda are again successfully undermining the narrow focus of the semester.",,Journal of Health Politics Policy and Law,,,2020-10-14,2020,,,,All OA; Gold,Article,"Greer, Scott L; Brooks, Eleanor","Greer, Scott L (University of Michigan.); Brooks, Eleanor (University of Edinburgh.)",,"Greer, Scott L (University of Michigan); Brooks, Eleanor (University of Edinburgh)",University of Edinburgh; University of Michigan,grid.4305.2; grid.214458.e,United Kingdom; United States,,0,0,,,4,https://read.dukeupress.edu/jhppl/article-pdf/doi/10.1215/03616878-8706615/825407/8706615.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1131949071,1606 Political Science; 1117 Public Health and Health Services; 11 Medical and Health Sciences; 16 Studies in Human Society,"16 Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions"

In the United States, COVID-19 disproportionately affects racial and ethnic minorities, particularly African Americans, with an observed two-fold higher rate for hospitalization and greater than two-fold higher rate for death as compared to White Americans. The disparity seen with COVID-19 is consistent with patterns of disparities observed for cancer; it is well-documented that 5-year survival rates for multiple cancers are lower in African Americans compared to White Americans. Root cause contributions for the disparity overlap between COVID-19 and cancer. While cancer is a genetic disease that is influenced by tissue microenvironment, COVID-19 is an infectious disease that is enabled by cellular expression of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors. However, socioeconomic disadvantages, level of education, lifestyle factors and health co-morbidities, and limited access to medical care appear to fuel underlying risk for both cancer and COVID-19 disparities. In addition to African Americans demonstrating higher risk of acquiring and dying from either disease, they are under-represented in clinical trials involving cancer or COVID-19. Long-term disparities are present with survivorship from cancer and may be likely with survivorship from COVID-19; both have revealed untoward effects on post-diagnosis economic viability for African Americans. Collaborative strategies that include community engagement, diverse participation in cancer and COVID-19 clinical trials, providing insurance for affected persons who lost employment due to either disease, and supporting safety-net and public hospitals for healthcare access will be critical to stem these disparities.",,Clinical Cancer Research,,,2020-10-13,2020,,,clincanres.3421.2020,All OA; Gold,Article,"Newman, Lisa; Winn, Robert A; Carethers, John M","Newman, Lisa (Surgery, Weill Cornell Medicine.); Winn, Robert A (Division of Pulmonary Disease and Critical Care Medicine, Virginia Commonwealth University.); Carethers, John M (Internal Medicine, University of Michigan-Ann Arbor jcarethe@umich.edu.)",,"Newman, Lisa (); Winn, Robert A (Virginia Commonwealth University); Carethers, John M (University of Michigan)",Virginia Commonwealth University; University of Michigan,grid.224260.0; grid.214458.e,United States; United States,National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities; National Cancer Institute; Susan G.

He is operated on in a maximum care hospital and then transferred to the critical care unit. From then on, an anonymous, very experienced physician continuously takes care of him. Four nights before Christmas, the ghost of the famous British physiologist Ernest Henry Starling appears at the patient's bed. The ghost involves the anonymous physician in a dialogue and is very interested in the inserted Swan-Ganz catheter, then he disappears. He repeats his visits the next 3 nights. On the first occasion he is displeased with Cratchit's low haematocrit, the second time he dislikes the mechanical ventilator settings, and on his final visit he is concerned with Cratchit's clinical nutrition. At first, the anonymous physician is indignant with the ghost's criticism and indoctrinations, but then recognizes that ultimately they are the key to Cratchit's convalescence and acts accordingly. Successfully! Following the ghost's proposals, he changes the ventilator settings, transfuses 3 units of packed red blood cells, and starts clinical nutrition. Shortly thereafter, Cratchit's trachea is extubated, and on New Year's Day he is ready to be discharged from the critical care unit. In this essay, Robert Bartlett transposed Charles Dickens' ""Christmas Carol"" into the world of critical care. Its intention is to encourage the intensivist to scrutinize common therapeutic measures, such as mechanical ventilation, haemodynamic interventions and transfusion of blood products.

The ability of health care providers to provide optimal care in this setting has not been formally evaluated.ObjectivesTo assess the impact of COVID-19 resource re-allocation on scheduling, testing, elective procedures, telemedicine access, use of new COVID-19 therapies, and providers’ opinions on healthcare policies among oncology and cardiology practitioners.MethodsAn electronic survey was conducted by a cardio-oncology collaborative network through regional and state chapters of the American College of Cardiology , American Society of Clinical Oncology, and the International Cardio-Oncology Society. Descriptive statistics were reported by frequency and proportion for analyses, and stratified categorically by geographic region and specialty.Results1,415 providers (43 countries) participated: 986 cardiologists, 306 oncologists, and 118 trainees/internal medicine. 63% (195/306) of oncologists vs 92% (896/976) of cardiologists reported cancellations of treatments/elective procedures (p=0.01). 46% (442/970) of cardiologists and 25% (76/303) of oncologists modified the scope of their practice (p=<0.001). Academic physicians (74.5%) felt better supplied with personal protective equipment (PPE) vs non-academic (74.5% vs 67.2%; p=0.018). Telemedicine was less common in Europe 81% (74/91), and Latin America 64% (101/158), than the United States, 88% (950/1,097) (p=<0.001). 95% of all groups supported more active leadership from medical professional societies.ConclusionsThese results support initiatives to promote expanded coverage for telemedicine, increased access to PPE, better testing availability and involvement of medical professional societies to help with preparedness for future health care crisis.Appendix: Link to the Survey: https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/C8ZDYNW",,Research Square,,,2020-10-12,2020,,,,"All OA; Green, Accepted & Submitted",Preprint,"Sadler, Diego; DeCara, Jeanne M.; Herrmann, Joerg; Arnold, Anita; Ghosh, Arjun K.; Abdel-Qadir, Husam; Yang, Eric H.; SZmit, Sebastian; Akhter, Nausheen; Leja, Monika; Silva, Carolina Maria Pinto Domingues Carvalho; Raikhelkar, Jayant; Brown, Sherry-Ann; O'Quinn, Rupal; Thuny, Franck; Moudgil, Rohit; Raez, Luis M.; Okwuosa, Tochukwu; Daniele, Andres; Bauer, Brenton; Kondapalli, Lavanya; Ismail-Khan, Roohi; Lax, Jorge; Blaes, Anne; Nahleh, Zeina; Elson, Leah; Baldassarre, Lauren; Zaha, Vlad; Rao, Vijay; Lara, Daniel Sierra; Skurka, Kerry; Dent, Susan","Sadler, Diego (Cleveland Clinic Florida); DeCara, Jeanne M.

Nevertheless, the monospecific IgG format is not optimal for many therapeutic applications, and this has led to the design of a vast number of unique multispecific antibody formats that enable targeting of multiple antigens or multiple epitopes on the same antigen. Despite the diversity of these formats, a common challenge in generating multispecific antibodies is that they display suboptimal physical and chemical properties relative to conventional IgGs and are more difficult to develop into therapeutics. Here we review advances in the design and engineering of multispecific antibodies with drug-like properties, including favorable stability, solubility, viscosity, specificity and pharmacokinetic properties. We also highlight emerging experimental and computational methods for improving the next generation of multispecific antibodies, as well as their constituent antibody fragments, with natural IgG-like properties. Finally, we identify several outstanding challenges that need to be addressed to increase the success of multispecific antibodies in the clinic.","We thank Alec Desai, Jie Huang, Matthew Smith, and Edward Ionescu for their scientific input during the initial stages of this review.",International Journal of Molecular Sciences,,,2020-10-12,2020,21,20,7496,All OA; Gold,Article,"Sawant, Manali S.; Streu, Craig N.; Wu, Lina; Tessier, Peter M.","Sawant, Manali S.

The United States Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness and Advancing Innovation Act of 2019 (PAHPAI) details the federal response to a health crisis including pandemics. The PAHPAI has hindered the nation’s response to COVID-19 due to its lack of emphasis on diagnostic testing (Burr 2019). Rapid testing is critical to slowing the spread of this disease. Ample testing will identify infected populations and will allow communities to take necessary precautions such as staying home and avoiding contact with others.

Studies are needed to directly compare multiple commercially available assays. METHODS: Residual serum samples were identified based on SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing, clinical test results, and collection dates. Serum samples were analyzed using assays from four different manufacturers: DiaSorin anti-SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG, EUROIMMUN anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG ELISA, Roche Elecsys anti-SARS-CoV-2, and Siemens SARS-CoV-2 Total antibody assays. RESULTS: Samples from SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR-positive patients became increasingly positive as time from symptom onset increased. For patients with latest sample 14 or more days after symptom onset, sensitivities reached 93.1% to 96.6%, 98.3%, and 96.6% for EUROIMMUN, Roche, and Siemens assays, respectively, which were superior to the DiaSorin assay at 87.7%. The specificity of Roche and Siemens assays was 100% and superior to DiaSorin and EUROIMMUN assays, which ranged from 96.1% to 97.0% and 86.3% to 96.4%, respectively.

Leveraging preliminary data from our unique nationwide Apple Hearing Study, we explored changes in personal sound exposures resulting from COVID-19-related social distancing. Volunteer participants opted to share environmental sound data from their Apple Watch and headphone sound data from their iPhone. Participants for this analysis were chosen from four states which exhibited diverse responses to COVID-19. Equivalent continuous average sound exposures (in A-weighted decibels, dBA) were computed per person-day and normalized to 8 hour LEX8h exposures. Daily mean LEX8h exposures across two time periods, a baseline period (before the first known US COVID-19 death at the time of analysis) and an intervention period (starting with each states first COVID-related public health social distancing announcement and ending on April 22, 2020) were defined to assess changes in sound exposure. We modeled sound levels across 5,894 participants and 516,729 monitored days using a linear mixed-effects model with random effects for participant. The overall reduction in LEX8h between baseline and intervention was 2.6 0.05 dBA (mean SE). There was a significant day-of-week effect during the baseline period, with the lowest exposures on Monday and the highest on Saturday. This effect was not noted during the intervention period. COVID-19 social distancing measures were associated with an approximately 3 dBA reduction in personal environmental sound exposures; this represents a substantial and meaningful reduction in this harmful exposure.

In particular, cellular senescence may enhance chronic lung diseases including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. However, the role cellular senescence plays in the pathophysiology of acute inflammatory diseases, especially viral infections, is less well-understood. There is evidence that cellular senescence prevents viral replication by increasing antiviral cytokines, but other evidence shows that senescence may enhance viral replication by downregulating antiviral signalling. Furthermore, cellular senescence leads to the secretion of inflammatory mediators, which may either promote host defense or exacerbate immune pathology during viral infections. In this perspective, we summarise how senescence contributes to physiology and disease, the role of senescence in chronic lung diseases, and how senescence impacts acute respiratory viral infections. Finally, we develop a potential framework of how senescence may contribute, both positively and negatively, to the pathophysiology of viral respiratory infections, including SARS-CoV-2.",,European Respiratory Journal,,,2020-10-08,2020,,,2002708,All OA; Gold,Article,"Kelley, William J; Zemans, Rachel L; Goldstein, Daniel R","Kelley, William J (Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.; Program in Immunology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI USA.); Zemans, Rachel L (Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.; Program in Immunology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.); Goldstein, Daniel R (Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.; Program in Immunology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI USA.)",,"Kelley, William J (University of Michigan; University of Michigan; University of Michigan); Zemans, Rachel L (University of Michigan; University of Michigan); Goldstein, Daniel R (University of Michigan; University of Michigan; University of Michigan)",University of Michigan,grid.214458.e,United States,National Institute on Aging,0,0,,,10,https://erj.ersjournals.com/content/erj/early/2020/10/02/13993003.02708-2020.full.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1131544013,1102 Cardiorespiratory Medicine and Haematology; 11 Medical and Health Sciences,

Therefore, we address the stakes of ""chosen family"" for queer and transgender (Q/T) young adults in terms of health, illness and the mutual provision of care. ""Chosen family"" is a refuge specifically generated by and for the queer experience, so we draw upon anthropological theory to explore questions of queer kinship in terms of care. We employ a phenomenological approach to semi-structured interviews (n = 11), open coding, and thematic analysis of transcriptions to meet our aims: (1) Develop an understanding of the beliefs and values that form the definition of ""chosen family"" for Q/T young adults; and (2) Understand the ways in which ""chosen family"" functions in terms of care for health and illness. Several themes emerged, allowing us to better understand the experiences of this population in navigating the concept of ""chosen family"" within and beyond health care settings. Emergent themes include: (1) navigating medical systems; (2) leaning on each other; and (3) mutual aid. These findings are explored, as are the implications of findings for how health care professionals can better engage Q/T individuals and their support networks.","The authors thank Lauren K.

In the current educational landscape, programs that meet these competencies are offered and attended in an ad hoc manner. During the COVID-19 pandemic and the accompanying switch to virtual learning, our team observed a surge in interest for our weekly non-sequential programs. In this study, we surveyed our learners to better understand motivators for attending these programs during the pandemic and to identify barriers for participating in such events before and during Work-From-Home. Our data indicate that conflict with research responsibilities, time spent to get to the event location, and planning time to attend are all significant barriers to engagement. Notably, feelings of being overwhelmed, which increased slightly during the pandemic, stood out as an identified barrier. Per our results, the virtual format was an attraction. While 58% of respondents would prefer to access professional development programs virtually in the future, almost 42% indicated a preference for in-person events when normalcy resumes as the physical presence of an instructor and of peers result in a deeper engagement. Our collective analysis here suggests that learners will benefit from a hybrid or combination of synchronous and asynchronous career and professional development programming in the future, even post-pandemic, to reduce identified barriers. Alongside hybrid learning engagements, we strongly recommend structured time for learners to enhance their professional competencies, enabled by a commitment from departments and faculty mentors to enable equity in professional skill building and fostering lifelong growth mindset.",The authors thank Dr. Manoj Puthenveedu and Dr. Kaylee Steen for critical feedback on the manuscript.

STUDY DESIGN: Case series. METHODS: Retrospective review of SGS patients treated from 1996 to 2018 at a single institution to assess for 1) V-RQOL association with individual patient cumulative treatment number and 2) V-RQOL correlation with treatment type, time between treatments, and degree of stenosis. Analysis included both parametric and nonparametric statistical comparison across treatment types and multivariable and univariate linear regression. RESULTS: Sixty-one patients, predominantly white (93%) and female (93%), were included. Etiology of SGS included idiopathic (61%), iatrogenic (16%), granulomatosis with polyangiitis (16%), and other (7%). The plurality of patients had four or more treatments (44%), with the remainder having one (28%), two (13%), or three treatments (15%). Analysis of change between pre- and postoperative V-RQOL scores was completed for 130 treatments. These included dilation with laser incision (52%), in-office injection (34%), dilation without division (8%), cricotracheal resection (1%), and all other treatment (8%). For every 10% improvement in airway caliber postoperatively, there was a 1.3-point improvement in calculated V-RQOL (r = 0.27, P = .02). After adjustment for treatment type, age, sex, and SGS etiology, this association held (beta = 1.5, P = .02). Change in V-RQOL was not associated with treatment type, treatment number, or time between treatments. CONCLUSION: Patients with subglottic stenosis who have greater degree of change in airway caliber experience greater improvement in V-RQOL scores following treatment. V-RQOL scores are not associated with treatment type or time between individual treatments.

The objective of this study was to examine the impact of COVID-19 on the practices, finances, and social aspects of Brazilian vascular surgeons' lives. METHODS: This is a descriptive analysis of the responses from Brazilian vascular surgeons to the cross-sectional anonymous Society for Vascular Surgery Wellness Task Force Pandemic Practice, Anxiety, Coping, and Support Survey for Vascular Surgeons disseminated 14-24 April 2020. Survey dissemination in Brazil occurred mainly via the Brazilian Society of Angiology and Vascular Surgery (SBACV) and social media. The survey evaluated the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on vascular surgeons' lives by assessing COVID-19-related stressors, anxiety using theGeneral Anxiety Disorder (GAD)-7 scale, and coping strategies using the Brief Coping Orientation to Problems Experienced (Brief-COPE) inventory. RESULTS: A total of 452 responses were recorded from Brazil, with 335 (74%) respondents completing the entire survey. The majority of respondents were males (N = 301, 67%) and practiced in an urban hospitals. The majority of respondents considered themselves at high risk to be infected with COVID-19 (N = 251, 55.8%), and just over half the respondents noted that they had adequate PPE at their primary hospital (N = 171, 54%). One hundred and nine (35%) surgeons confirmed that their hospitals followed professional surgical society guidelines for prioritizing surgeries during the pandemic. At the time of the survey, only 33 (10%) surgeons stated they have pre-operative testing of patients for COVID-19 available at their hospital. Academic vascular surgeons reported being redeployed more often to help with other non-vascular duties compared to community-based or solo practitioners (43% vs. 30% vs. 21% respectively, P = .01). Severe anxiety due to pandemic-related financial concerns was similar in those surgeons practicing solo compared to those in community- or academic-based/group practice (46% vs. 38% vs. 22%; P = .54). The respondents reported their anxiety levels as mild based on the stressors investigated instead of moderate-severe (54% vs. 46%; P = .04). Social media was utilized heavily during the pandemic, with video gatherings being the most commonly used tool (76%). Self-distraction (60%) and situational acceptance (81%) were the most frequently reported coping mechanisms used among Brazilian vascular surgeons. CONCLUSION: The COVID pandemic has greatly affected healthcare providers around the world. At the time of this survey, Brazilian vascular surgeons are reporting low anxiety levels during this time and are using mostly active coping mechanisms.",,Vascular,,,2020-10-06,2020,,,1708538120954961,All OA; Gold,Article,"Malgor, Rafael D; Sobreira, Marcone Lima; Mouawad, Nicolas J; Johnson, Adam P; Wohlauer, Max V; Coogan, Sheila M; Cuff, Robert F; Coleman, Dawn M; Sheahan, Malachi G; Woo, Karen; Shalhub, Sherene","Malgor, Rafael D (Anschutz Medical Center, Division of Vascular Surgery and Endovascular Therapy, The University of Colorado, Aurora, CO, USA.); Sobreira, Marcone Lima (Division of Vascular Surgery, Botucatu School of Medicine, Sao Paulo State University, Botucatu, Brazil.); Mouawad, Nicolas J (Vascular & Endovascular Surgery, McLaren Health System, Bay City, MI, USA.); Johnson, Adam P (New York/Presbyterian Weill Cornell School of Medicine, New York, NY, USA.); Wohlauer, Max V (Anschutz Medical Center, Division of Vascular Surgery and Endovascular Therapy, The University of Colorado, Aurora, CO, USA.); Coogan, Sheila M (Department of Cardiovascular Surgery, University of Texas at Houston, Houston, TX, USA.); Cuff, Robert F (Vascular Surgery, Spectrum Health Medical Group, Grand Rapids, MI, USA.); Coleman, Dawn M (Department of Surgery, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.); Sheahan, Malachi G (Division of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery, Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center, New Orleans, LA, USA.); Woo, Karen (Division of Vascular Surgery.

0,pub.1131427185,10.1111/eth.13096,,,Teaching animal behavior online: A primer for the pandemic and beyond,"Behavior courses face numerous challenges when moving to an online environment, as has been made necessary by the COVID‐19 pandemic. These challenges occur largely because behavior courses, like most organismal biology courses, often stress experiential learning through laboratories that involve live animals, as well as a lecture component that emphasizes formative assessment, discussion, and critical thinking. Although online behavior courses may be remote, they can still be interactive and social, and designed with inclusive pedagogy. Here, we discuss some of the key decisions that instructors should consider, provide recommendations, and point out new opportunities for student learning that stem directly from the move to online instruction. Specific topics include challenges related to generating an inclusive and engaging online learning environment, synchronous versus asynchronous formats, assignments that enhance student learning, testing format and execution, grade schemes, design of laboratory experiences including opportunities for community science, design of synthetic student projects, and workload balance for students and instructors. We designed this primer both for animal behavior instructors who need to quickly transition to online teaching in the midst of a pandemic, and for those facing such transitions in upcoming terms. Much of the manuscript's content should also be of general interest and value to instructors from all areas of organismal biology who are attempting to quickly transition to online teaching. Teaching behavior online presents both challenges and opportunities. In this comprehensive guide, we offer suggestions for the design and implementation of online behavior courses. For all aspects of these courses, including lectures, discussions and labs, we emphasize a backwards‐design approach and the importance of flexibility, inclusivity, equity, and accessibility. We also offer recommendations for delivery mode, specific course components, and resources for additional support.","David Logue indirectly brought this team together by starting the Behaviour and Evolution Teaching Facebook Group, where we first met and then branched off for detailed discussions in the Behavior Slack site.

Behavior analysts should anticipate encountering such treatments in practice and understand their ethical obligations with regard to these practices. Thoughts on why pseudoscientific practices are frequently sought are presented for context in understanding this complex issue. This discussion will serve to prepare behavior analysts for how to address situations in which clients may ask behavior analysts to use pseudoscientific practices. Additionally, this discussion covers arguments for the dangers of using pseudoscientific practices, a guide to resources for information on evidence‐based practice and ethics, and ideas on how to handle a situation in which a parent or caregiver asks the behavior analyst to integrate a pseudoscientific approach into the treatment of a child with a neurodevelopmental disorder.",,Behavioral Interventions,,,2020-10-05,2020,,,,Closed,Article,"Capuano, Angela M.; Killu, Kim","Capuano, Angela M.

Yet, access to the levels of water supply that support good hand hygiene and institutional cleaning, our understanding of hygiene behaviours, and access to soap are deficient in low-, middle- and high-income countries. This paper reviews the role of water, sanitation and hygiene (WaSH) in disease emergence, previous outbreaks, combatting COVID-19 and in preparing for future pandemics. We consider settings where these factors are particularly important and identify key preventive contributions to disease control and gaps in the evidence base. Urgent substantial action is required to remedy deficiencies in WaSH, particularly the provision of reliable, continuous piped water on-premises for all households and settings. Hygiene promotion programmes, underpinned by behavioural science, must be adapted to high-risk populations (such as the elderly and marginalised) and settings (such as healthcare facilities, transport hubs and workplaces). WaSH must be better integrated into preparation plans and with other sectors in prevention efforts. More finance and better use of financing instruments would extend and improve WaSH services. The lessons outlined justify no-regrets investment by government in response to and recovery from the current pandemic; to improve day-to-day lives and as preparedness for future pandemics.",,Journal of Water and Health,,"Aged; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Hygiene; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Sanitation; Water",2020-10-01,2020,18,5,613-630,All OA; Gold,Article,"Howard, Guy; Bartram, Jamie; Brocklehurst, Clarissa; Colford, John M.; Costa, Federico; Cunliffe, David; Dreibelbis, Robert; Eisenberg, Joseph Neil Spindel; Evans, Barbara; Girones, Rosina; Hrudey, Steve; Willetts, Juliet; Wright, Caradee Y.","Howard, Guy (Department of Civil Engineering, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK); Bartram, Jamie (School of Civil Engineering, University of Leeds, Leeds, UK; Gilling School of Global Public Health, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, USA); Brocklehurst, Clarissa (Gilling School of Global Public Health, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, USA); Colford, John M.

Reasons for this disparity may be due to underlying comorbidities or sociodemographic factors that require further exploration. Objective: To systematically determine patient characteristics associated with racial/ethnic disparities in COVID-19 outcomes. Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective cohort study used comparative groups of patients tested or treated for COVID-19 at the University of Michigan from March 10, 2020, to April 22, 2020, with an outcome update through July 28, 2020. A group of randomly selected untested individuals were included for comparison. Examined factors included race/ethnicity, age, smoking, alcohol consumption, comorbidities, body mass index (BMI; calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared), and residential-level socioeconomic characteristics. Exposure: In-house polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests, commercial antibody tests, nasopharynx or oropharynx PCR deployed by the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services and reverse transcription-PCR tests performed in external labs. Main Outcomes and Measures: The main outcomes were being tested for COVID-19, having test results positive for COVID-19 or being diagnosed with COVID-19, being hospitalized for COVID-19, requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission for COVID-19, and COVID-19-related mortality (including inpatient and outpatient). Medical comorbidities were defined from the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, and International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, codes and were aggregated into a comorbidity score. Associations with COVID-19 outcomes were examined using odds ratios (ORs). Results: Of 5698 patients tested for COVID-19 (mean [SD] age, 47.4 [20.9] years; 2167 [38.0%] men; mean [SD] BMI, 30.0 [8.0]), most were non-Hispanic White (3740 patients [65.6%]) or non-Hispanic Black (1058 patients [18.6%]). The comparison group included 7168 individuals who were not tested (mean [SD] age, 43.1 [24.1] years; 3257 [45.4%] men; mean [SD] BMI, 28.5 [7.1]). Among 1139 patients diagnosed with COVID-19, 492 (43.2%) were White and 442 (38.8%) were Black; 523 (45.9%) were hospitalized, 283 (24.7%) were admitted to the ICU, and 88 (7.7%) died. Adjusting for age, sex, socioeconomic status, and comorbidity score, Black patients were more likely to be hospitalized compared with White patients (OR, 1.72 [95% CI, 1.15-2.58]; P = .009). In addition to older age, male sex, and obesity, living in densely populated areas was associated with increased risk of hospitalization (OR, 1.10 [95% CI, 1.01-1.19]; P = .02). In the overall population, higher risk of hospitalization was also observed in patients with preexisting type 2 diabetes (OR, 1.82 [95% CI, 1.25-2.64]; P = .02) and kidney disease (OR, 2.87 [95% CI, 1.87-4.42]; P",,JAMA Network Open,,"Adult; African Americans; Aged; Betacoronavirus; Comorbidity; Coronavirus Infections; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; European Continental Ancestry Group; Female; Health Status Disparities; Hospitalization; Humans; Intensive Care Units; Kidney Diseases; Male; Michigan; Middle Aged; Neoplasms; Obesity; Odds Ratio; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Population Density; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors",2020-10-01,2020,3,10,e2025197,All OA; Gold,Article,"Gu, Tian; Mack, Jasmine A.; Salvatore, Maxwell; Sankar, Swaraaj Prabhu; Valley, Thomas S.; Singh, Karandeep; Nallamothu, Brahmajee K.; Kheterpal, Sachin; Lisabeth, Lynda; Fritsche, Lars G.; Mukherjee, Bhramar","Gu, Tian (Department of Biostatistics, University of Michigan School of Public Health, Ann Arbor); Mack, Jasmine A.

However, inappropriate PICC use may lead to patient harm. Objective: To evaluate whether infectious disease physician approval prior to PICC placement for intravenous antimicrobials is associated with more appropriate device use and fewer complications. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study of 21 653 PICCs placed for a primary indication of intravenous antimicrobial therapy between January 1, 2015, and July 26, 2019, was conducted in 42 hospitals participating in a quality collaborative across Michigan among hospitalized medical patients. Main Outcomes and Measures: Appropriateness of PICCs was defined according to the Michigan Appropriateness Guide for Intravenous Catheters as a composite measure of (1) single-lumen catheter use, (2) avoiding use of PICCs for 5 days or less, and (3) avoiding use of PICCs for patients with chronic kidney disease (defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate <45 mL/min/1.73 m2). Complications related to PICCs included catheter occlusion, deep vein thrombosis, and central line-associated bloodstream infection. The association between infectious disease physician approval, device appropriateness, and catheter complications was assessed using multivariable models, adjusted for patient comorbidities and hospital clustering. Results were expressed as odds ratios with 95% CIs. Results: A total of 21 653 PICCs were placed for intravenous antimicrobials (11 960 PICCs were placed in men [55.2%]; median age, 64.5 years [interquartile range, 53.4-75.4 years]); 10 238 PICCs (47.3%) were approved by an infectious disease physician prior to placement. Compared with PICCs with no documented approval, PICCs with approval by an infectious disease physician were more likely to be appropriately used (72.7% [7446 of 10 238] appropriate with approval vs 45.4% [5180 of 11 415] appropriate without approval; odds ratio, 3.53; 95% CI, 3.29-3.79; P",,JAMA Network Open,,,2020-10-01,2020,3,10,e2017659,All OA; Gold,Article,"Vaughn, Valerie M.; O’Malley, Megan; Flanders, Scott A.; Gandhi, Tejal N.; Petty, Lindsay A.; Malani, Anurag N.; Weinmann, Allison; Horowitz, Jennifer K.; Chopra, Vineet","Vaughn, Valerie M.

While students appreciate the option of participating either face-to-face (F2F) or remotely (RMT), questions remain whether RMT students are as engaged and learning at the same rate as students participating F2F. A survey course on extreme weather has been offered in a blended synchronous format for multiple semesters. The course was live-streamed, and students could freely decide whether to attend F2F or RMT on a class-by-class basis. Technology allowed all students to answer formative assessment questions and ask questions during class sessions. The pros for offering the blended synchronous environment were found to be: 1) it was very popular with students and 2) the rate of attendance (∼85% daily) was considered significantly higher than the daily attendance rates in previous semesters. The cons for the blended synchronous environment were that students choosing the remote mode of participation did not appear to be as attentive and their exam grades were lower. More troubling, it appears that students who had lower incoming grade point averages (iGPA) tended to prefer participating remotely, which may represent that these students used the option to avoid a deeper commitment to engagement. Significantly, it was also found that students with lower iGPA who chose to participate in class activities at a higher frequency and choosing to more frequently attend class physically, received grades similar to higher iGPA students.While blended learning increases options for student participation it will be important to monitor how its availability affects student participation and learning and especially those students who have been previously less successful academically.",,Journal of Geoscience Education,,,2020-10-01,2020,68,4,1-10,All OA; Gold,Article,"Samson, Perry J.","Samson, Perry J.

An aim of this study was to assess lung autopsy findings in COVID-19 inpatients, and in untreated severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-positive individuals who died in the community, in order to understand the relative impact of medical intervention on lung histology. Additionally, we aimed to investigate whether COVID-19 represents a unique histological variant of DAD by comparing the pathological findings with those of uninfected control patients. METHODS AND RESULTS: Lung sections from autopsy cases were reviewed by three pulmonary pathologists, including two who were blinded to patient cohort. The cohorts included four COVID-19 inpatients, four cases with postmortem SARS-CoV-2 diagnoses who died in the community, and eight SARS-CoV-2-negative control cases. DAD was present in all but one SARS-CoV-2-positive patient, who was asymptomatic and died in the community. Although SARS-CoV-2-positive patients were noted to have more focal perivascular inflammation/endothelialitis than control patients, there were no significant differences in the presence of hyaline membranes, fibrin thrombi, airspace organisation, and 'acute fibrinous and organising pneumonia'-like intra-alveolar fibrin deposition between the cohorts. Fibrinoid vessel wall necrosis, haemorrhage and capillaritis were not features of COVID-19-related DAD. CONCLUSIONS: DAD is the primary histological manifestation of severe lung disease in COVID-19 patients who die both in hospital and in the community, suggesting no contribution of hyperoxaemic mechanical ventilation to the histological changes. There are no distinctive morphological features with which to confidently differentiate COVID-19-related DAD from DAD due to other causes.",,Histopathology,,"Adult; Aged; Alveolar Epithelial Cells; Autopsy; Betacoronavirus; Cohort Studies; Coronavirus Infections; Female; Humans; Lung; Male; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Surveys and Questionnaires",2020-10,2020,77,4,570-578,All OA; Gold,Article,"Konopka, Kristine E; Nguyen, Teresa; Jentzen, Jeffrey M; Rayes, Omar; Schmidt, Carl J; Wilson, Allecia M; Farver, Carol F; Myers, Jeffrey L","Konopka, Kristine E (Department of Pathology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA); Nguyen, Teresa (Department of Pathology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA); Jentzen, Jeffrey M (Department of Pathology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA); Rayes, Omar (Department of Pathology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA); Schmidt, Carl J (Department of Pathology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA); Wilson, Allecia M (Department of Pathology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA); Farver, Carol F (Department of Pathology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA); Myers, Jeffrey L (Department of Pathology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA)",,"Konopka, Kristine E (University of Michigan); Nguyen, Teresa (University of Michigan); Jentzen, Jeffrey M (University of Michigan); Rayes, Omar (University of Michigan); Schmidt, Carl J (University of Michigan); Wilson, Allecia M (University of Michigan); Farver, Carol F (University of Michigan); Myers, Jeffrey L (University of Michigan)",University of Michigan,grid.214458.e,United States,,13,13,,,17,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1111/his.14180,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1128480044,1102 Cardiorespiratory Medicine and Haematology; 11 Medical and Health Sciences,

Patients with diabetes are particularly vulnerable and more likely to get severe complications when infected with this virus. Although the information continues to emerge, here we provide our perspective on initial outcomes observed in hospitalized patients with diabetes and the potential role played by the proinflammatory metabolic state in these patients that promotes fertile ground for the virus' inflammatory surge, resulting in severe insulin resistance and severe hyperglycemia. The rapidly evolving renal failure, hypotension, pressor and steroid use, and variable nutritional support further complicates their management. Thus, timely implementation of glucose management protocols addressing these complex scenarios while also following COVID-19-related trajectories in inflammatory biomarkers and being cognizant of the health care provider exposure may substantially affect morbidity and mortality.",,Diabetes,,"Betacoronavirus; Blood Glucose; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Hyperglycemia; Intensive Care Units; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral",2020-10,2020,69,10,2048-2053,All OA; Gold,Article,"Gianchandani, Roma; Esfandiari, Nazanene H.; Ang, Lynn; Iyengar, Jennifer; Knotts, Sharon; Choksi, Palak; Pop-Busui, Rodica","Gianchandani, Roma (Division of Metabolism, Endocrinology and Diabetes, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI); Esfandiari, Nazanene H.

Although the impact of acid suppression on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 is unknown thus far, previous data revealed that pH ≤3 impairs the infectivity of the similar severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 1. Thus, we aimed to determine whether use of PPIs increases the odds for acquiring coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) among community-dwelling Americans. METHODS: From May 3 to June 24, 2020, we performed an online survey described to participating adults as a ""national health survey."" A multivariable logistic regression was performed on reporting a positive COVID-19 test to adjust for a wide range of confounding factors and to calculate adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: Of 53,130 participants, 3,386 (6.4%) reported a positive COVID-19 test. In regression analysis, individuals using PPIs up to once daily (aOR 2.15; 95% CI, 1.90-2.44) or twice daily (aOR 3.67; 95% CI, 2.93-4.60) had significantly increased odds for reporting a positive COVID-19 test when compared with those not taking PPIs. Individuals taking histamine-2 receptor antagonists were not at elevated risk. DISCUSSION: We found evidence of an independent, dose-response relationship between the use of antisecretory medications and COVID-19 positivity; individuals taking PPIs twice daily have higher odds for reporting a positive test when compared with those using lower-dose PPIs up to once daily, and those taking the less potent histamine-2 receptor antagonists are not at increased risk. These findings emphasize good clinical practice that PPIs should only be used when indicated at the lowest effective dose, such as the approved once-daily label dosage of over-the-counter and prescription PPIs. Further studies examining the association between PPIs and COVID-19 are needed.",,The American Journal of Gastroenterology,,"Adolescent; Adult; Betacoronavirus; Clinical Laboratory Techniques; Confounding Factors, Epidemiologic; Coronavirus Infections; Drug Prescriptions; Female; Gastric Acid; Gastric Mucosa; Gastroesophageal Reflux; Gastrointestinal Microbiome; Health Surveys; Heartburn; Humans; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Proton Pump Inhibitors; Young Adult",2020-10,2020,115,10,10.14309/ajg.0000000000000798,"All OA; Green, Published",Article,"Almario, Christopher V.; Chey, William D.; Spiegel, Brennan M.R.","Almario, Christopher V.

SARS-CoV-2 uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for entry into host cells. Since ACE2 is a susceptibility factor for infection, we investigated how diabetic kidney disease and medications alter ACE2 receptor expression in kidneys. Single cell RNA profiling of healthy living donor and kidney biopsies from patients with diabetic kidney disease revealed ACE2 expression primarily in proximal tubular epithelial cells. This cell specific localization was confirmed by in situ hybridization. ACE2 expression levels were unaltered by exposures to renin angiotensin aldosterone system inhibitors in diabetic kidney disease. Bayesian integrative analysis of a large compendium of public-omics datasets identified molecular network modules induced in ACE2-expressing proximal tubular epithelial cells in diabetic kidney disease (searchable at hb.flatironinstitute.org/covid-kidney) that were linked to viral entry, immune activation, endomembrane reorganization, and RNA processing. The diabetic kidney disease ACE2-positive proximal tubular epithelial cell module overlapped with expression patterns seen in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells. Similar cellular programs were seen in ACE2-positive proximal tubular epithelial cells obtained from urine samples of 13hospitalized patients with COVID-19, suggesting a consistent ACE2-coregulated proximal tubular epithelial cell expression program that may interact with the SARS-CoV-2 infection processes. Thus SARS-CoV-2 receptor networks can seed further research into risk stratification and therapeutic strategies for COVID-19 related kidney damage.","We thank Ms. Lois Jones, RN, Mr. Enrique Diaz, RN, Ms. Bernadine Waseta, and Ms. Camille Waseta for performing the studies in the diabetes cohort and the University of Michigan Advanced Genomics Core for providing expert technical assistance with single cell processing and sequencing.

Most critically ill patients have respiratory failure and there is an international effort to understand mechanisms and predictors of disease severity. Coagulopathy, characterized by elevations in D-dimer and fibrin(ogen) degradation products (FDPs), is associated with critical illness and mortality in patients with COVID-19. Furthermore, increasing reports of microvascular and macrovascular thrombi suggest that hemostatic imbalances may contribute to the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 infection. We review the laboratory and clinical findings of patients with COVID-19-associated coagulopathy, and prior studies of hemostasis in other viral infections and acute respiratory distress syndrome. We hypothesize that an imbalance between coagulation and inflammation may result in a hypercoagulable state. Although thrombosis initiated by the innate immune system is hypothesized to limit SARS-CoV-2 dissemination, aberrant activation of this system can cause endothelial injury resulting in loss of thromboprotective mechanisms, excess thrombin generation, and dysregulation of fibrinolysis and thrombosis. The role various components including neutrophils, neutrophil extracellular traps, activated platelets, microparticles, clotting factors, inflammatory cytokines, and complement play in this process remains an area of active investigation and ongoing clinical trials target these different pathways in COVID-19.","The authors would like to thank Charles Bolan, MD and Jason Knight, MD, PhD for guidance and review of the manuscript, and all members of the ‘NETwork to Target Neutrophils in COVID-19’ and the SVM Next Generation Committee for their helpful advice and encouragement.

Logistic regression with multiple adjustments (e.g., comorbidities, cancer status, baseline COVID-19 severity) was performed. Hydroxychloroquine with any other drug was associated with increased mortality versus treatment with any COVID-19 treatment other than hydroxychloroquine or untreated controls; this association was not present with hydroxychloroquine alone. Remdesivir had numerically reduced mortality versus untreated controls that did not reach statistical significance. Baseline COVID-19 severity was strongly associated with receipt of any treatment. Black patients were approximately half as likely to receive remdesivir as white patients. Although observational studies can be limited by potential unmeasured confounding, our findings add to the emerging understanding of patterns of care for patients with cancer and COVID-19 and support evaluation of emerging treatments through inclusive prospective controlled trials. SIGNIFICANCE: Evaluating the potential role of COVID-19 treatments in patients with cancer in a large observational study, there was no statistically significant 30-day all-cause mortality benefit with hydroxychloroquine or high-dose corticosteroids alone or in combination; remdesivir showed potential benefit. Treatment receipt reflects clinical decision-making and suggests disparities in medication access.This article is highlighted in the In This Issue feature, p. 1426.","This study was partly supported by grants from the American Cancer Society and Hope Foundation for Cancer Research (MRSG-16-152-01-CCE; to D.P.

STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a cross-sectional survey from June 16 to July 16, 2020 of U.S. children's hospitals regarding protocols for management of patients with MIS-C. Elements included characteristics of the hospital, clinical definition of MIS-C, evaluation, treatment, and follow up. We summarized key findings and compared results from centers in which >5 patients had been treated vs those in which <5 patients had been treated. RESULTS: In all, 40 centers of varying size and experience with MIS-C participated in this protocol survey. Overall 21 of 40 centers required only one day of fever for MIS-C to be considered. In the evaluation of patients, there was often a tiered approach. Intravenous immunoglobulin was the most widely recommended medication to treat MIS-C (98% of centers). Corticosteroids were listed in 93% of protocols primarily for moderate or severe cases. Aspirin was commonly recommended for mild cases, whereas heparin or low molecular weight heparin were to be used primarily in severe cases. In severe cases, anakinra and vasopressors were frequently recommended; 39 of 40 centers recommended follow up with cardiology. There were similar findings between centers in which >5 patients vs. <5 patients had been managed. Supplemental materials containing hospital protocols are provided. CONCLUSION: There are many similarities yet key differences between hospital protocols for MIS-C. These findings can help healthcare providers learn from others regarding options for managing MIS-C.","We thank the additional individuals who contributed data to this survey including: Eva Cheung MD (NewYork-Presbyterian Morgan Stanley Children’s Hospital of Columbia Irving Medical Center), Lauren Henderson MD MMSc (Boston Children’s Hospital), Whitnee J.

The impact of this virus on our health, relationships, and careers is difficult to overstate. As the economic realities for academic medical centers come into focus, we must recommit to our core missions of patient care, education, and research. Fellowship education programs in gynecologic oncology have quickly adapted to the ""new normal"" of social distancing using video conferencing platforms to continue clinical and didactic teaching. United in a time of crisis, we have embraced systemic change by developing and delivering collaborative educational content, overcoming the limitations imposed by institutional silos. Additional innovations are needed in order to overcome the losses in program surgical volume and research opportunities. With the end of the viral pandemic nowhere in sight, program directors can rethink how education is best delivered and potentially overhaul aspects of fellowship curriculum and content. Similarly, restrictions on travel and the need for social distancing has transformed the 2020 fellowship interview season from an in-person to a virtual experience. During this time of unprecedented and rapid change, program directors should be particularly mindful of the needs and health of their trainees and consider tailoring their educational experiences accordingly.",,Gynecologic Oncology,,,2020-10,2020,,,,All OA; Gold,Article,"Ferriss, J Stuart; Rose, Steve; Rungruang, Bunja; Urban, Renata; Spencer, Ryan; Uppal, Shitanshu; Sinno, Abdulrahman K; Duska, Linda; Walsh, Christine","Ferriss, J Stuart (Kelly Gynecologic Oncology Service, Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA.

When available and within constraints of institutional guidelines, it is preferable for patients scheduled for motility procedures to complete a coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) test within 48 hours before their procedure, similar to the recommendations before endoscopy made by gastroenterology societies. COVID-19 test results must be documented before performing procedures. If procedures are to be performed without a COVID-19 test, full PPE use is recommended, along with all social distancing and infection control measures. Because patients with suspected motility disorders may require multiple procedures, sequential scheduling of procedures should be considered to minimize need for repeat COVID-19 testing. The strategies for and timing of procedure(s) should be adapted, taking into consideration local institutional standards, with the provision for screening without testing in low prevalence areas. If tested positive for COVID-19, subsequent negative testing may be required before scheduling a motility procedure (timing is variable). Specific recommendations for each motility procedure including triaging, indications, PPE use, and alternatives to motility procedures are detailed in the document.

However, initial reports of ECMO use in patients with COVID-19 described very high mortality and there have been no large, international cohort studies of ECMO for COVID-19 reported to date. METHODS: We used data from the Extracorporeal Life Support Organization (ELSO) Registry to characterise the epidemiology, hospital course, and outcomes of patients aged 16 years or older with confirmed COVID-19 who had ECMO support initiated between Jan 16 and May 1, 2020, at 213 hospitals in 36 countries. The primary outcome was in-hospital death in a time-to-event analysis assessed at 90 days after ECMO initiation. We applied a multivariable Cox model to examine whether patient and hospital factors were associated with in-hospital mortality. FINDINGS: Data for 1035 patients with COVID-19 who received ECMO support were included in this study. Of these, 67 (6%) remained hospitalised, 311 (30%) were discharged home or to an acute rehabilitation centre, 101 (10%) were discharged to a long-term acute care centre or unspecified location, 176 (17%) were discharged to another hospital, and 380 (37%) died. The estimated cumulative incidence of in-hospital mortality 90 days after the initiation of ECMO was 37·4% (95% CI 34·4-40·4). Mortality was 39% (380 of 968) in patients with a final disposition of death or hospital discharge. The use of ECMO for circulatory support was independently associated with higher in-hospital mortality (hazard ratio 1·89, 95% CI 1·20-2·97). In the subset of patients with COVID-19 receiving respiratory (venovenous) ECMO and characterised as having acute respiratory distress syndrome, the estimated cumulative incidence of in-hospital mortality 90 days after the initiation of ECMO was 38·0% (95% CI 34·6-41·5). INTERPRETATION: In patients with COVID-19 who received ECMO, both estimated mortality 90 days after ECMO and mortality in those with a final disposition of death or discharge were less than 40%. These data from 213 hospitals worldwide provide a generalisable estimate of ECMO mortality in the setting of COVID-19.

One of the most promising, if they can be successfully developed, is vaccines. While the technological development of such countermeasures is currently underway, a key social gap remains. Past experience in routine and crisis contexts demonstrates that uptake of vaccines is more complicated than simply making the technology available. Vaccine uptake, and especially the widespread acceptance of vaccines, is a social endeavor that requires consideration of human factors. To provide a starting place for this critical component of a future COVID-19 vaccination campaign in the United States, the 23-person Working Group on Readying Populations for COVID-19 Vaccines was formed. One outcome of this group is a synthesis of the major challenges and opportunities associated with a future COVID-19 vaccination campaign and empirically-informed recommendations to advance public understanding of, access to, and acceptance of vaccines that protect against SARS-CoV-2. While not inclusive of all possible steps than could or should be done to facilitate COVID-19 vaccination, the working group believes that the recommendations provided are essential for a successful vaccination program.",,Vaccine,,,2020-10,2020,,,,Closed,Article,"Schoch-Spana, Monica; Brunson, Emily K; Long, Rex; Ruth, Alexandra; Ravi, Sanjana J; Trotochaud, Marc; Borio, Luciana; Brewer, Janesse; Buccina, Joseph; Connell, Nancy; Hall, Laura Lee; Kass, Nancy; Kirkland, Anna; Koonin, Lisa; Larson, Heidi; Lu, Brooke Fisher; Omer, Saad B; Orenstein, Walter A; Poland, Gregory A; Privor-Dumm, Lois; Quinn, Sandra Crouse; Salmon, Daniel; White, Alexandre","Schoch-Spana, Monica (Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, Baltimore, MD, USA; Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, MD, USA.

The risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission to healthcare staff during AGPs is well documented, and negative-pressure rooms are often unavailable. Innovative techniques to decrease risk to healthcare providers during AGPs are necessary. Our objective was to demonstrate the feasibility of percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy (PDT) performed using a novel prefabricated low-cost negative-pressure tent (AerosolVE). METHODS: Retrospective review of consecutive PDT procedures performed by neurointensivists on intubated adult patients with COVID-19 using the AerosolVE tent during the pandemic under an innovative clinical care protocol. The AerosolVE negative-pressure tent consists of a clear plastic canopy with slits for hand access attached to a U-shaped base with air vents. Air within the tent is drawn through a high-efficiency particulate air filter and released outside. Preliminary testing during simulated AGPs demonstrated negligible escape of particulate matter beyond the tent. The main outcome measure was successful completion of PDT and bronchoscopy within the AerosolVE tent, without complications. RESULTS: The patients were a 53-year-old man with multifocal ischemic stroke and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), 53-year-old woman with cerebellar hemorrhage and ARDS, and a 69-year-old man with ARDS. Pre-procedure FiO2 requirement was 40-50% and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) 8-12 cm H2O. The tent was successfully positioned around the patient and PDT completed with real-time ultrasound guidance in all 3 patients. Bronchoscopy was performed to confirm tube position and perform pulmonary toilet. No complications occurred. CONCLUSIONS: It is feasible to perform PDT on intubated COVID-19 patients using the AerosolVE negative-pressure tent. This is a promising low-cost device to decrease risk to healthcare providers during AGPs.","We would like to acknowledge Nathan L. Haas, MD, Henrique Alencastro Puls, MD, Kevin R.

METHODS AND MATERIALS: A panel of international experts from ASTRO, ESTRO, and select Asia-Pacific countries completed a modified rapid Delphi process. Topics and questions were presented to the group, and subsequent questions were developed from iterative feedback. Each survey was open online for 24 hours, and successive rounds started within 24 hours of the previous round. The chosen cutoffs for strong agreement (≥80%) and agreement (≥66%) were extrapolated from the RAND methodology. Two pandemic scenarios, early (risk mitigation) and late (severely reduced radiation therapy resources), were evaluated. The panel developed treatment recommendations for 5 HNC cases. RESULTS: In total, 29 of 31 of those invited (94%) accepted, and after a replacement 30 of 30 completed all 3 surveys (100% response rate). There was agreement or strong agreement across a number of practice areas, including treatment prioritization, whether to delay initiation or interrupt radiation therapy for intercurrent SARS-CoV-2 infection, approaches to treatment (radiation dose-fractionation schedules and use of chemotherapy in each pandemic scenario), management of surgical cases in event of operating room closures, and recommended adjustments to outpatient clinic appointments and supportive care. CONCLUSIONS: This urgent practice recommendation was issued in the knowledge of the very difficult circumstances in which our patients find themselves at present, navigating strained health care systems functioning with limited resources and at heightened risk to their health during the COVID-19 pandemic. The aim of this consensus statement is to ensure high-quality HNC treatments continue, to save lives and for symptomatic benefit.","The authors thank Anne W.M.

Methods: The Committee for ASRS Best Practices for Retinal Surgery During the COVID-19 Pandemic reviewed existing evidence and information on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission and risk factors during vitreoretinal surgery. Recommendations were based on best available published data, cumulative clinical experiences, and recommendations and policies from other organizations. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach was used to assess the strength of recommendations and confidence in the evidence. These serve as interim recommendations that will be routinely updated given the current gaps of knowledge and lack of high-quality data on this evolving subject.   Results: Relevant existing literature related to methods of transmission and ocular manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 are summarized. The data and clinical experiences driving recommendations for preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative surgical considerations and anesthesia choice as well as considerations for intravitreal injections are provided.   Conclusions: Recommendations are provided with the goal of protecting vitreoretinal surgeons and associated personnel from exposure to SARS-CoV-2 during interventional vitreoretinal procedures. This is a rapidly evolving topic with numerous remaining gaps in our current knowledge. As such, recommendations will evolve and the present article is intended to serve as a foundation for continued dialogue on best practices.","We would like to acknowledge the leadership of the Retina Society, Macula Society, and the Vit-Buckle Society for endorsing the recommendations and this manuscript.",Journal of VitreoRetinal Diseases,,,2020-10,2020,4,5,420-429,All OA; Gold,Article,"Chao, Daniel L.; Sridhar, Jayanth; Kuriyan, Ajay E.; Leng, Theodore; Barnett, Brad P.; Carlin, Aaron F.; Wykoff, Charles C.; Gayer, Stephen; Mruthyunjaya, Prithvi; Yonekawa, Yoshihiro; Fawzi, Amani A.; Berrocal, Audina M.; Yeh, Steven; Ting, Daniel; Modi, Yasha; Zacks, David N.; Yannuzzi, Nicholas; Afshari, Natalie A.; Murray, Timothy","Chao, Daniel L.

This project assessed aggregate changes in the quality of the evidence supporting these schedules to establish a comprehensive evidence base for future reference and highlight aspects for future study. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Based on a systematic review of published recommendations related to dose fractionation during the COVID-19 pandemic, 20 expert panelists assigned to 14 disease groups named and graded the highest quality of evidence schedule(s) used routinely for each condition and also graded all COVID-era recommended schedules. The American Society for Radiation Oncology quality of evidence criteria were used to rank the schedules. Process-related statistics and changes in distributions of quality ratings of the highest-rated versus recommended COVID-19 era schedules were described by disease groups and for specific clinical scenarios. RESULTS: From January to May 2020 there were 54 relevant publications, including 233 recommended COVID-19-adapted dose fractionations. For site-specific curative and site-specific palliative schedules, there was a significant shift from established higher-quality evidence to lower-quality evidence and expert opinions for the recommended schedules (P = .022 and P < .001, respectively). For curative-intent schedules, the distribution of quality scores was essentially reversed (highest levels of evidence ""pre-COVID"" vs ""in-COVID"": high quality, 51.4% vs 4.8%; expert opinion, 5.6% vs 49.3%), although there was variation in the magnitude of shifts between disease sites and among specific indications. CONCLUSIONS: A large number of publications recommended hypofractionated radiation therapy schedules across numerous major disease sites during the COVID-19 pandemic, which were supported by a lower quality of evidence than the highest-quality routinely used dose fractionation schedules. This work provides an evidence-based assessment of these potentially practice-changing recommendations and informs individualized decision-making and counseling of patients. These data could also be used to support radiation therapy practices in the event of second waves or surges of the pandemic in new regions of the world.",,International Journal of Radiation Oncology • Biology • Physics,,"Coronavirus Infections; Dose Fractionation, Radiation; Evidence-Based Medicine; Humans; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Publications",2020-10,2020,108,2,379-389,All OA; Gold,Article,"Thomson, David J.; Yom, Sue S.; Saeed, Hina; Naqa, Issam El; Ballas, Leslie; Bentzen, Soren M.; Chao, Samuel T.; Choudhury, Ananya; Coles, Charlotte E.; Dover, Laura; Guadagnolo, B.

METHODS: CT volumes from 2,398 United States radiology practices participating in the ACR Dose Index Registry from January 1, 2020, to September 30, 2020, were analyzed. Data were compared to projected CT volumes using 2019 normative data and analyzed with respect to time since government orders, population-normalized positive COVID-19 tests, and attributed deaths. Data were stratified by state population density, unemployment status, and race. RESULTS: There were 16,198,830 CT examinations (2,398 practices). Volume nadir occurred an average of 32 days after each state-of-emergency declaration and 12 days after each stay-at-home order. At nadir, the projected volume loss was 38,043 CTs per day (of 71,626 CTs per day; 53% reduction). Over the entire study period, there were 3,689,874 fewer CT examinations performed than predicted (of 18,947,969; 19% reduction). There was less reduction in states with smaller population density (15% [169,378 of 1,142,247; quartile 1] versus 21% [1,894,152 of 9,140,689; quartile 4]) and less reduction in states with a lower insured unemployed proportion (13% [279,331 of 2,071,251; quartile 1] versus 23% [1,753,521 of 7,496,443; quartile 4]). By September 30, CT volume had returned to 84% (59,856 of 71,321) of predicted; recovery of CT volume occurred as positive COVID-19 tests rose and deaths were in decline. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 substantially reduced US CT volume, reflecting delayed and deferred care, especially in states with greater unemployment. Partial volume recovery occurred despite rising positive COVID-19 tests.",,Journal of the American College of Radiology,,,2020-10,2020,,,,All OA; Gold,Article,"Davenport, Matthew S; Fruscello, Tom; Chatfield, Mythreyi; Weinstein, Stefanie; Sensakovic, William F; Larson, David B","Davenport, Matthew S (Associate Chair of Operations Service Chief of Adult Radiology, Departments of Radiology and Urology, Michigan Medicine, Ann Arbor, Michigan.

It stands to reason that the spread of the virus depends on sociocultural ecologies that facilitate or inhibit social contact. In particular, the community-level tendency to engage with strangers and freely choose friends, called relational mobility, creates increased opportunities to interact with a larger and more variable range of other people. It may therefore be associated with a faster spread of infectious diseases, including COVID-19. Here, we tested this possibility by analyzing growth curves of confirmed cases of and deaths due to COVID-19 in the first 30 days of the outbreaks in 39 countries. We found that growth was significantly accelerated as a function of a country-wise measure of relational mobility. This relationship was robust either with or without a set of control variables, including demographic variables, reporting bias, testing availability, and cultural dimensions of individualism, tightness, and government efficiency. Policy implications are also discussed.",,Psychological Science,,"BCG Vaccine; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Cross-Cultural Comparison; Humans; Internationality; Models, Biological; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Public Health; Social Behavior; Vaccination",2020-10,2020,31,10,1236-1244,All OA; Gold,Article,"Salvador, Cristina E.; Berg, Martha K.; Yu, Qinggang; San Martin, Alvaro; Kitayama, Shinobu","Salvador, Cristina E.

Though disparities in COVID-19 hospitalization by race-ethnicity are large, disparities by income and education have not been studied. Using an index based on preexisting health conditions and age, we estimate disparities in vulnerability to hospitalization from COVID-19 by income, education, and race-ethnicity for U.S. adults. The index uses estimates of health condition and age effects on hospitalization for respiratory distress prior to the pandemic validated on COVID-19 hospitalizations. We find vulnerability arising from preexisting conditions is nearly three times higher for bottom versus top income quartile adults and 60 % higher for those with a high-school degree relative to a college degree. Though non-Hispanic Blacks are more vulnerable than non-Hispanic Whites at comparable ages, among all adults the groups are equally vulnerable because non-Hispanic Blacks are younger. Hispanics are the least vulnerable. Results suggest that income and education disparities in hospitalization are likely large and should be examined directly to further understand the unequal impact of the pandemic.","This paper was prepared with support, in part, from the Aging Studies Institute at Syracuse University, the Duke Center for Population Health and Aging, which receives core support (P30AG034424) from the National Institute on Aging, and by the California Center for Population Research at the University of California at Los Angeles, which receives core support (P2C-HD041022) from the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development.

Radiologists and radiology trainees were asked to register to attend the live sessions. At the end of the course, we conducted a 46-question survey among registrants addressing their training level, perception of virtual conferencing, and evaluation of the course content. RESULTS: One thousand four hundred and thirty four radiologists and trainees completed interest sign up forms before the start of the course with the first webinar having the highest number of live attendees (343 people). On average, there were 89 live participants per session and 750 YouTube views per recording (as of July 9, 2020). After the end of the course, 487 attendees from 37 countries responded to the postcourse survey for an overall response rate of (33%). Approximately (63%) of participants were practicing radiologists while (37%) were either fellows or residents and rarely medical students. The overwhelming majority (97%) found the OLIC webinar series to be beneficial. Essentially all attendees felt that the webinar sessions met (43%) or exceeded (57%) their expectations. When asked about their perception of virtual conferences after attending OLIC lectures, almost all attendees (99%) enjoyed the virtual conference with a majority (61%) of the respondents who enjoyed the virtual format more than in-person conferences, while (38%) enjoyed the webinar format but preferred in-person conferences. When asked about the willingness to attend virtual webinars in the future, (84%) said that they would attend future virtual conferences even if in-person conferences resume while (15%) were unsure. CONCLUSION: The success of the OLIC, attributed to many factors, indicates that videoconferencing technology provides an inexpensive alternative to in-person radiology conferences. The positive responses to our postcourse survey suggest that virtual education will remain to stay. Educational institutions and scientific societies should foster such models.",We would like to acknowledge the time and effort of our faculty. Their commitment to education helped to make the OLIC a successful event.

We investigated an association between delay in radical prostatectomy and oncologic outcomes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a retrospective review of men with intermediate and high risk prostate cancer in the National Cancer Database undergoing radical prostatectomy from 2010 to 2016. Immediate radical prostatectomy was defined as radical prostatectomy within 3 months of diagnosis, while delayed radical prostatectomy was analyzed in 3-month intervals up to 12 months. Multivariable logistic regression models were fit to test for associations between levels of delayed radical prostatectomy and outcomes of interest (adverse pathology, upgrading on radical prostatectomy, node positive disease and post-radical prostatectomy secondary treatments) compared with men undergoing immediate radical prostatectomy. RESULTS: We identified 128,062 men with intermediate and high risk prostate cancer treated with radical prostatectomy. After adjustment, we did not appreciate a significant difference in odds of adverse pathology, upgrading, node positive disease or post-radical prostatectomy secondary treatments between men treated with immediate radical prostatectomy and any level of delay up to 12 months. Subgroup analysis of men with Grade Group 4 and 5 prostate cancer did not demonstrate an association between delayed radical prostatectomy and worse oncologic outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: In the National Cancer Database delayed radical prostatectomy was not associated with early adverse oncologic outcomes at radical prostatectomy. These results may provide reassurance to patients and urologists balancing care in the current pandemic.",,The Journal of Urology,,"Aged; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Logistic Models; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Grading; Neoplasm Staging; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Prostatectomy; Prostatic Neoplasms; Retrospective Studies; Risk Assessment; Time-to-Treatment",2020-10,2020,204,4,720-725,All OA; Gold,Article,"Ginsburg, Kevin B; Curtis, Gannon L; Timar, Ryan E; George, Arvin K; Cher, Michael L","Ginsburg, Kevin B (Department of Urology, Wayne State University, Detroit, Michigan.); Curtis, Gannon L (Department of Urology, Wayne State University, Detroit, Michigan.); Timar, Ryan E (Wayne State University, School of Medicine, Detroit, Michigan.); George, Arvin K (Department of Urology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan.); Cher, Michael L (Wayne State University, Detroit, Michigan.)",,"Ginsburg, Kevin B (Wayne State University); Curtis, Gannon L (Wayne State University); Timar, Ryan E (Wayne State University); George, Arvin K (University of Michigan); Cher, Michael L (Wayne State University)",Wayne State University; University of Michigan,grid.254444.7; grid.214458.e,United States; United States,,10,10,,,45,https://www.auajournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1097/JU.0000000000001089,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1127263778,1117 Public Health and Health Services; 11 Medical and Health Sciences,

Using data from Turkey, we calculated the elasticity of Covid-19 spread with respect to population weighted density to be 0.67 after controlling for other factors. In addition to the density, the proportion of people over 65, the per capita GDP, and the number of total health care workers in each city positively contributed to the case numbers, while education level and temperature had a negative effect.

Our institution created a prenatal care delivery model incorporating these alternative approaches to continue safely providing prenatal care during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate institutional-level adoption and patient and provider experiences with the coronavirus disease 2019 prenatal care model. STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a single-site evaluation of a coronavirus disease 2019 prenatal care model incorporating a reduced frequency visit schedule and virtual visits deployed at a suburban academic institution on March 20, 2020. We used electronic health record data to evaluate institution-level model adoption, defined as changes in overall visit frequency and proportion of virtual visits in the 3 months before and after implementation. To evaluate the patient and provider experience with the coronavirus disease 2019 model, we conducted an online survey of all pregnant patients (>20 weeks' gestation) and providers in May 2020. Of note, 3 domains of care experience were evaluated: (1) access, (2) quality and safety, and (3) satisfaction. Quantitative data were analyzed with basic descriptive statistics. Free-text responses coded by the 3 survey domains elucidated drivers of positive and negative care experiences. RESULTS: After the coronavirus disease 2019 model adoption, average weekly prenatal visit volume fell by 16.1%, from 898 to 761 weekly visits; the average weekly proportion of prenatal visits conducted virtually increased from 10.8% (97 of 898) to 43.3% (330 of 761); and the average visit no-show rate remained stable (preimplementation, 4.3%; postimplementation, 4.2%). Of those eligible, 74.8% of providers (77 of 103) and 15.0% of patients (253 of 1690) participated in the surveys. Patient respondents were largely white (180 of 253; 71.1%) and privately insured (199 of 253; 78.7%), reflecting the study site population. The rates of chronic conditions and pregnancy complications also differed from national prevalence. Provider respondents were predominantly white (44 of 66; 66.7%) and female (50 of 66; 75.8%). Most patients and almost all providers reported that virtual visits improved access to care (patients, 174 of 253 [68.8%]; providers, 74 of 77 [96.1%]). More than half of respondents (patients, 124 of 253 [53.3%]; providers, 41 of 77 [62.1%]) believed that virtual visits were safe. Nearly all believed that home blood pressure cuffs were important for virtual visits (patients, 213 of 231 [92.2%]; providers, 63 of 66 [95.5%]). Most reported satisfaction with the coronavirus disease 2019 model (patients, 196 of 253 [77.5%]; providers, 64 of 77 [83.1%]). In free-text responses, drivers of positive care experiences were similar for patients and providers and included perceived improved access to care through decreased barriers (eg, transportation, childcare), perceived high quality of virtual visits for low-risk patients and increased safety during the pandemic, and improved satisfaction through better patient counseling. Perceived drivers of negative care experience were also similar for patients and providers, but less common. These included concerns that unequal access to virtual visits could deepen existing maternity care inequities, concerns that the lack of home devices (eg, blood pressure cuffs) would affect care quality and safety, and dissatisfaction with poor patient-provider continuity and inadequate expectation setting for the virtual visit experience. CONCLUSION: Reduced visit schedules and virtual visits were rapidly integrated into real-world care, with positive experiences for many patients and providers. Future research is needed to understand the health outcomes and care experience associated with alternative approaches to prenatal care delivery across more diverse patient populations outside of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic to inform broader health policy decisions.",,American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology,,,2020-10,2020,,,,All OA; Gold,Article,"Peahl, Alex F; Powell, Allison; Berlin, Hanna; Smith, Roger D; Krans, Elizabeth; Waljee, Jennifer; Dalton, Vanessa K; Heisler, Michele; Moniz, Michelle H","Peahl, Alex F (Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI; Institute for Healthcare Policy and Innovation, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI; Program on Women's Healthcare Effectiveness Research, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI.

More than one-third (34.7%) of parents said their child's behavior had changed since the pandemic, including being sad, depressed, and lonely. Most parents were spending more time involved in daily caregiving of their children since COVID-19. Two out of every five parents met the PHQ-8 criteria for major depression or severe major depression (40.0%) and the GAD-7 criteria for moderate or severe anxiety (39.9%). Multivariate analyses indicated that, compared to non-depressed parents, parents who met criteria for probable major or severe depression (B = -.16, 95% CI = [-.29, -.02], p = .021) and parenting stress (B = -.37, 95% CI = [-.47, -.27], p < .001) were negatively associated with parents' perceived preparation to educate at home. Compared to parents with minimal or mild anxiety, parents with moderate or severe anxiety reported higher child anxiety scores (B = .17, 95% CI = [.06, .28], p = .002). Parenting stress was also positively associated with higher child anxiety scores (B = .40, 95% CI = [.32, .48], p < .001). Content analyses of open-ended questions indicated that school closures were a significant disruption, followed by lack of physical activity, and social isolation. Overall, study results suggested that parents' mental health may be an important factor linked to at-home education and child wellbeing during the pandemic.",,Children and Youth Services Review,,,2020-10,2020,,,105585,"All OA; Green, Published",Article,"Lee, Shawna J; Ward, Kaitlin P; Chang, Olivia D; Downing, Kasey M","Lee, Shawna J (University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.); Ward, Kaitlin P (University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.); Chang, Olivia D (University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.); Downing, Kasey M (University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.)","Lee, Shawna J (University of Michigan)","Lee, Shawna J (University of Michigan); Ward, Kaitlin P (University of Michigan); Chang, Olivia D (University of Michigan); Downing, Kasey M (University of Michigan)",University of Michigan,grid.214458.e,United States,,0,0,,,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7553006,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1131628020,16 Studies in Human Society; 1607 Social Work; 1402 Applied Economics; 14 Economics,

This study aimed to quantify the tradeoff of PA under fine particulate matter (PM2.5) air pollution by estimating the optimal PA duration under various pollution levels. METHODS: A risk-benefit analysis was performed to estimate the optimal outdoor moderate PA (MPA) duration under varying PM2.5 concentrations. RESULTS: An inverse nonlinear relationship was identified between optimal MPA duration and background PM2.5 concentration levels. When background PM2.5 concentration increased to 186 µg/m3, the optimal outdoor MPA duration decreased to 2.5 h/week, the minimum level recommended by current PA guidelines. When background PM2.5 concentration further increased to 235 µg/m3, the optimal outdoor MPA duration decreased to 1 h/week. The relationship between optimal MPA duration and background PM2.5 concentration levels was stronger when exercising at a location closer to a source of air pollution. Compared to the general adult population, adults aged 60 years and older had substantially steeper curves-the optimal outdoor MPA duration decreased to 2.5 h/week when background PM2.5 concentration reached 45 µg/m3. CONCLUSION: The health benefit of outdoor MPA by far outweighs the health risk of PM2.5 pollution for the global average urban background concentration (22 μg/m3). This modeling study examined a single type of air pollutant and suffered from measurement errors and estimation uncertainties. Future research should examine other air pollutants and indoor PA, incorporate short- and mid-term health effects of MPA and air pollution into the risk-benefit analysis, and provide estimates specific for high-risk subgroups.",,Journal of Sport and Health Science,,,2020-10,2020,,,,All OA; Gold,Article,"An, Ruopeng; Kang, Hyojung; Cao, Lianzhong; Xiang, Xiaoling","An, Ruopeng (Brown School, Washington University, St. Louis, MO 63130, USA.); Kang, Hyojung (Department of Kinesiology and Community Health, University of Illinois, Champaign, IL 61820, USA.); Cao, Lianzhong (School of Management and Journalism, Shenyang Sport University, Shenyang 110102, Liaoning, China.

However, the effect of threat may be attenuated for those high in interdependent self-construal (SC) since this SC affords a sense of protection against the threat. Here, we tested this possibility by priming or not priming young American adults with a pathogen threat. We then had participants read norm-violating or normal behaviors while assessing two electrocortical markers: N400 (indexing the detection of norm violations) and suppression of upper α-band power (indexing vigilance to the violations). In the threat priming condition, interdependent SC predicted decreased responsiveness to norm violations. In the control priming condition, however, interdependent SC predicted increased responsiveness.

This project extends a previous pilot couples-focused HIV intervention programme, which was shown to be feasible, acceptable and promising in reducing sexual risk behaviour among transgender women and their partners. This randomised controlled trial (RCT) tests the efficacy of this culturally sensitive HIV prevention programme for HIV-serodiscordant and HIV-negative seroconcordant transgender women and their partners. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: To finalise the protocol for trial, we used qualitative methods to hone eligibility criteria, refine the intervention and control manuals, and name and brand the intervention ('It Takes Two'). The RCT investigates the effects of the It Takes Two intervention on Composite Risk for HIV (CR-HIV) among 100 couples. CR-HIV is a binary indicator of couple HIV risk using validated measures of sexual behaviour, pre-exposure prophylaxis use among HIV-negative participants and viral suppression among participants living with HIV. Using a two-arm RCT, we will examine intervention effects on CR-HIV at 12-month follow-up comparing transgender women and their partners randomised to the intervention versus control (HIV prevention information only). ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study has been reviewed and approved by the University of California, San Francisco (19-28624) and the University of Michigan (HUM00147690) Institutional Review Boards. Participants provide informed consent before taking part of the study activities. Results will be published in peer-reviewed journals and presented at scientific conferences. We will make our results available to the community of researchers and general public interested in transgender health to avoid unintentional duplication of research, as well as to others in the health and social services community, including LGBT community-based organisations, AIDS service organisations and other transgender-serving organisations.

We conducted a study to determine if Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) minimum case requirements, resident case logs, and graduating resident perceived readiness for practice are aligned with the procedural demand and needs of the current urology workforce. DESIGN: Correlative study comparing the association between (1) workforce demand and ACGME case requirements, and (2) workforce demand and perceived resident competency. Three distinct datasets were used; (1) the 2017 Medicare Part B National Summary Data File; (2) the 2017 National Data Report published by the ACGME; and (3) a graduating resident survey from Okhunov et al. SETTING: N/A. PARTICIPANTS: N/A. RESULTS: In 2017, there were a total of 6,784,696 urologic cases performed through Medicare. We found nonsignificant positive associations between resident case logs (rho = 0.16, p = 0.5784), ACGME minimum procedure requirements (rho = 0.42, p = 0.1255), and Medicare procedural demand. Our 15 index procedures accounted for 21.1% (n = 1,431,775) of all Medicare cases, with a median number of 7706 procedures. Endopyelotomy was the least common procedure (n = 98), while cystoscopy was the most common (n = 980,623). Medicare case volume was positively correlated with graduating residents' procedural confidence (r = 0.86, p < 0.0001). We identified four categories with varied alignment of training and demand: (1) high volume and high confidence, (2) high volume and low confidence, (3) low volume and high confidence, and (4) low volume and low confidence. CONCLUSIONS: Optimizing urology residency training is time-sensitive and important. Using national Medicare data coupled with recently graduated urology resident survey results, we provide a guiding framework for improving the alignment of training with workforce demand. Informed by these results, we recommend altering training requirements to reflect these needs.",,Journal of Surgical Education,,,2020-10,2020,,,,"All OA; Green, Published",Article,"Cruz, Alan Paniagua; Skolarus, Ted A; Ambani, Sapan N; Hafez, Khaled; Kraft, Kate H","Cruz, Alan Paniagua (Department of Urology, Lenox Hill Hospital, New York, NY.); Skolarus, Ted A (Department of Urology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan; VA HSR&D Center for Clinical Management Research, VA Ann Arbor Healthcare System, Ann Arbor, Michigan; Dow Division of Health Services Research, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan.); Ambani, Sapan N (Department of Urology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan.); Hafez, Khaled (Department of Urology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan.); Kraft, Kate H (Department of Urology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan.

METHODS: We conducted a narrative review of the most significant papers published in the areas of cancer screening, incidence, mortality and palliative care in SMI. RESULTS: Data from the literature confirm disparities in screening (eg, mammography; pap-smear test; colorectal cancer screening) and prevention (eg, clinical breast examination; smoking cessation). The incidence of cancer was found to be variable with a portion of the studies reporting a higher prevalence while others a similar or a lower prevalence of cancer compared to the general population. A lower percentage of patients with SMI received proper cancer treatment resulting in survival after cancer diagnosis significantly worse than people without SMI. Likewise, end-of-life care has been shown to be lacking with poorer levels of physical, psychological and spiritual care. CONCLUSIONS: The problems of stigma and discrimination, poorer dignity, poorer health behavior, lack of integration in health-care services for people with SMI needs to be addressed and solved in cancer care. Psycho-oncology has a very specific and mandatory role in integrating the recommendation of the World Health Organization to improve the links between oncology and mental health settings for more specific psycho-oncology programs addressed for this vulnerable segment of the population.",,Psycho-Oncology,,,2020-10,2020,29,10,1445-1451,Closed,Article,"Grassi, Luigi; Riba, Michelle","Grassi, Luigi (Institute of Psychiatry, Department of Biomedical and Specialty Surgical Sciences, University of Ferrara, Ferrara, Italy); Riba, Michelle (Department of Psychiatry, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA; University of Michigan Depression Center, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA; Psycho‐oncology Program, University of Michigan Rogel Cancer Center, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA)",,"Grassi, Luigi (University of Ferrara); Riba, Michelle (University of Michigan; University of Michigan; University of Michigan)",University of Michigan; University of Ferrara,grid.214458.e; grid.8484.0,United States; Italy,World Health Organization,0,0,,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1130755226,1117 Public Health and Health Services; 11 Medical and Health Sciences,3 Good Health and Well Being

The critical question that needs to be addressed is whether HCWs are willing to accept and purchase this vaccine. The objective of this study was to evaluate the acceptance and willingness to pay (WTP) for the vaccine among HCWs. METHODS: From May to July 2019, a cross-sectional study was conducted among registered general practitioners (GPs) in Indonesia. A contingent valuation method was employed to evaluate the WTP. Besides acceptance and WTP, various explanatory variables were also collected and assessed. A logistic regression and a multivariable linear regression were used to explore the explanatory variables influencing acceptance and WTP, respectively. RESULTS: Among 407 respondents, 391 (96.0%) expressed acceptance of a free vaccination. The mean and median WTP was US$ 37.0(95%CI:US$ 32.76-US$ 41.23) and US$ 17.90(95%CI:US$ 17.90-US$ 17.90), respectively. In an unadjusted analysis, those 30 years old or younger had 2.94 times greater odds of vaccine acceptance compared to those who were older (95%CI: 1.07-8.08). Location of alma mater, type of workplace, length of individual medical experience, and monthly income of GPs were all significantly associated with WTP. CONCLUSION: Although the vast majority of GPs would accept a freely provided vaccine, they were also somewhat price sensitive. This finding indicates that partial subsidy maybe required to achieve high vaccine coverage, particularly among GPs at community health centres or those with a shorter duration of medical practice.",,Vaccine,,,2020-10,2020,38,43,6800-6806,Closed,Article,"Harapan, Harapan; Wagner, Abram L.; Yufika, Amanda; Setiawan, Abdul M.; Anwar, Samsul; Wahyuni, Sri; Asrizal, Febrivan W.; Sufri, Muhammad R.; Putra, Reza P.; Wijayanti, Nanda P.; Salwiyadi, Salwiyadi; Maulana, Razi; Khusna, Afriyani; Nusrina, Ina; Shidiq, Muhammad; Fitriani, Devi; Muharrir, Muharrir; Husna, Cut A.; Yusri, Fitria; Maulana, Reza; Rajamoorthy, Yogambigai; Groneberg, David Alexander; Müller, Ruth; Mudatsir, Mudatsir","Harapan, Harapan (Medical Research Unit, School of Medicine, Syiah Kuala University, Banda Aceh, Aceh 23111, Indonesia; Tropical Disease Centre, School of Medicine, Syiah Kuala University, Banda Aceh, Aceh 23111, Indonesia; Department of Microbiology, School of Medicine, Syiah Kuala University, Banda Aceh, Aceh 23111, Indonesia); Wagner, Abram L.

Although social class mobility is often attributed to perceptions of hard work, science does not support these dominant narratives. Instead, access to quality education and structural supports correlate with economic uplift. By eliminating structural barriers to low-income college students’ degree completion and coordinating efforts to assist low-income students, policymakers can restore the promise of economic mobility through education. This article focuses on the psychological and behavioral science that should inform higher education policy.

Research on pathogen detection and avoidance suggests that perceivers respond with caution both to true signs of infection and to cues only heuristically associated with infection threat. But what do perceivers actually believe about the effectiveness and use of specific sensory modalities for infection detection? In several studies, participants reported perceptions of effectiveness and likelihood of using each of the major senses to identify infection threat in two types of targets: people and food. Results revealed prioritization of sight and sound with person targets and prioritization of sight and smell with food targets. These patterns appear consistent with the use of “safe senses” (avoidance of cues involving high perceived transmission risk). Beliefs about sensory use also varied depending on the specific feature being examined, with different patterns of sensory beliefs associated with evaluation of pathogenic danger than with evaluation of desirability and fit with normative standards. We discuss these lay beliefs in the context of recent calls for descriptive research in psychology as well as their implications for current and future work on the behavioral immune system.","Acknowledgements We thank Spencer Dobbs for his help in study development and preparation of this manuscript.

Aquatic animals like fish where the adaptive immunity is poorly developed majorly rely on their innate immunity modulated by PRRs like toll-like receptors (TLR) and NOD-like receptors (NLR). However, current development to improve the fish immunity via TLR/NLR signaling is affected by a poor understanding of its mechanistic and structural features. This review discusses the structure of fish TLRs/NLRs and its interaction with pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and downstream signaling molecules. Over the past one decade, significant progress has been done in studying the structure of TLRs/NLRs in higher eukaryotes; however, structural studies on fish innate immune receptors are undermined. Several novel TLR genes are identified in fish that are absent in higher eukaryotes, but the function is still poorly understood. Unlike the fundamental progress achieved in developing antagonist/agonist to modulate human innate immunity, analogous studies in fish are nearly lacking due to structural inadequacy. This underlies the importance of exploring the structural and mechanistic details of fish TLRs/NLRs at an atomic and molecular level. This review outlined the mechanistic and structural basis of fish TLR and NLR activation.","The author thanks Dr. D.K.

Interventions, such as clean cookstoves, household water treatment, and improved sanitation facilities, have great potential to yield reductions in disease burden. However, in recent trials and implementation efforts, interventions to improve HAP and WASH conditions have shown few of the desired health gains, raising fundamental questions about current approaches. OBJECTIVES: We describe how the failure to consider the complex systems that characterize diverse real-world conditions may doom promising new approaches prematurely. We provide examples of the application of systems approaches, including system dynamics, network analysis, and agent-based modeling, to the global environmental health priorities of HAP and WASH research and programs. Finally, we offer suggestions on how to approach systems science. METHODS: Systems science applied to environmental health can address major challenges by a) enhancing understanding of existing system structures and behaviors that accelerate or impede aims; b) developing understanding and agreement on a problem among stakeholders; and c) guiding intervention and policy formulation. When employed in participatory processes that engage study populations, policy makers, and implementers, systems science helps ensure that research is responsive to local priorities and reflect real-world conditions. Systems approaches also help interpret unexpected outcomes by revealing emergent properties of the system due to interactions among variables, yielding complex behaviors and sometimes counterintuitive results. DISCUSSION: Systems science offers powerful and underused tools to accelerate our ability to identify barriers and facilitators to success in environmental health interventions. This approach is especially useful in the context of implementation research because it explicitly accounts for the interaction of processes occurring at multiple scales, across social and environmental dimensions, with a particular emphasis on linkages and feedback among these processes. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP7010.",Financial support from the NIH Common Fund’s Global Health program for the Clean Cooking Implementation Science Network and from the Boston College School of Social Work enabled the 2018 workshop where these ideas were initially developed.

As a major transnational enterprise, illegal wildlife trade is valued between eight and 26.5 billion US dollars annually [3,4]. Because law enforcement is often only reactive, information on trafficking routes is key to disrupting trade and curtailing wildlife crime. In our efforts to uncover trade routes of trafficked sea turtle eggs, we developed and field-tested the InvestEGGator, a 3D-printed decoy turtle egg embedded with a GPS-GSM transmitter (Supplemental Information). Illegally collected clutches of turtle eggs containing a decoy transmitter enabled us to track the movements of traffickers, and thus gain a better understanding of illegal trade routes. The decoys, set to emit a signal once an hour, provided five tracks, the most detailed of which identified an entire trade chain, covering 137 km. Using data provided by the decoys, we identified trafficking routes and on two occasions properties of potential interest to law enforcement. Decoys also yielded anecdotal information, furthering our understanding of trafficking routes.","This project was funded by the Economics and Social Research Council, USAID Wildlife Crime Tech Challenge and supporters of Turtle Tracks to whom we are most grateful.

We recursively analyzed 56 qualitative interviews with young adults in a large metropolitan area in 2016-2018 and prospective longitudinal nationally representative survey data (PSID-CDS-2007 and PSID-TAS-2017) to articulate a conceptual framework of life course influences on young adults’ time spent using digital technologies. Inductive qualitative analyses built an initial framework, which was assessed with quantitative data, then further refined with qualitative analyses. Young adults drew on life course perspectives when discussing influences on their current digital technology use. As they suggested, in quantitative analyses more frequent adolescent technology use and greater device access weakly predicted increased technology frequency. Current school enrollment and several current peer factors predicted technology time. Interviewees emphasized the influence of parenting around technology use during adolescence, but parenting did not predict young adult screen time in quantitative analyses. Further qualitative analyses suggested that instead of influencing current technology time, earlier parenting shaped current emotional responses and imagined future technology use. We found young adults’ technology use frequency to be informed by earlier experiences but highly malleable. Past technology use and current social contexts matter, but only up to a point. Moving beyond time use to incorporate emotional responses and future plans can better capture how the life course shapes technology use.",,Advances in Life Course Research,,,2020-10,2020,,,100379,Closed,Article,"Mollborn, Stefanie; Fomby, Paula; Goode, Joshua A.; Modile, Adenife","Mollborn, Stefanie (Institute of Behavioral Science and Department of Sociology, University of Colorado Boulder, United States); Fomby, Paula (Institute for Social Research, University of Michigan, 426 Thompson St, Ann Arbor, MI 48106, United States); Goode, Joshua A.

Whether to share information is often not a real choice, since sharing is required for basic transactions such as obtaining utilities, services, or products. Furthermore, scale matters, and information assymetries can quickly create playing fields that are not level. Even in these bleak circumstances, there is reason for hope that we develop socio‐technical systems that better align with our values.

Perceptions of nurses regarding parental discharge preparation and relevant tools can inform implementation. Purpose To describe nurses’ perceptions of discharge preparedness and implementation of a standardized tool to facilitate nurse-parent engagement in discharge education. Methods We conducted semi-structured interviews with seven nurses meeting eligibility criteria. Interviews were conducted using an interview guide developed for this study and were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and thematically analyzed. Results Three major themes emerged: 1) Discharge Education is an Ongoing and Evolving Process; 2) Nurse-Parent Partnerships; and 3) Importance of Context to Implementation of Standardized Tools. Sub-themes emerged from the data to support each major theme. Conclusion Standardized tools can improve parent discharge preparedness and implementation of these tools is facilitated by well-described processes, partnerships between nurses and parents, and tailoring to the unit context.",This research was supported in part by Dr. Clayton Shuman&#x27;s Research Start-up funds from the University of Michigan School of Nursing.,Journal of Neonatal Nursing,,,2020-10,2020,,,,Closed,Article,"DesMadryl, Megan; Mazur, Kathleen M.; VanAntwerp, Katherine; Ziegman, Corrie; Nemshak, Michelle; Shuman, Clayton J.","DesMadryl, Megan (School of Nursing, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA); Mazur, Kathleen M.

Understanding these molecular mechanisms in the pathogenesis of septic shock will be an important next step for developing novel diagnostic and treatment modalities. We sought to determine the expression of CitH3 in patients with septic shock, and to correlate CitH3 levels with PAD2/PAD4 and clinically relevant outcomes. METHODS: Levels of CitH3 were measured in serum samples of 160 critically ill patients with septic and non-septic shock, and healthy volunteers. Analyses of clinical and laboratory characteristics of patients were conducted. RESULTS: Levels of circulating CitH3 at enrollment were significantly increased in septic shock patients (n = 102) compared to patients hospitalized with non-infectious shock (NIC) (n = 32, p",We would like to thank Dr. John G.

DESIGN: Multicenter cohort study. SETTING: Intensive care units at 68 geographically diverse hospitals across the United States. PARTICIPANTS: Critically ill adults (age ≥18 years) with laboratory confirmed covid-19. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: In-hospital cardiac arrest within 14 days of admission to an intensive care unit and in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: Among 5019 critically ill patients with covid-19, 14.0% (701/5019) had in-hospital cardiac arrest, 57.1% (400/701) of whom received cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Patients who had in-hospital cardiac arrest were older (mean age 63 (standard deviation 14) v 60 (15) years), had more comorbidities, and were more likely to be admitted to a hospital with a smaller number of intensive care unit beds compared with those who did not have in-hospital cardiac arrest. Patients who received cardiopulmonary resuscitation were younger than those who did not (mean age 61 (standard deviation 14) v 67 (14) years). The most common rhythms at the time of cardiopulmonary resuscitation were pulseless electrical activity (49.8%, 199/400) and asystole (23.8%, 95/400). 48 of the 400 patients (12.0%) who received cardiopulmonary resuscitation survived to hospital discharge, and only 7.0% (28/400) survived to hospital discharge with normal or mildly impaired neurological status. Survival to hospital discharge differed by age, with 21.2% (11/52) of patients younger than 45 years surviving compared with 2.9% (1/34) of those aged 80 or older. CONCLUSIONS: Cardiac arrest is common in critically ill patients with covid-19 and is associated with poor survival, particularly among older patients.","STOP-COVID investigators: A Bilal Malik, Abbas

We undertook an online survey to measure the willingness-to-pay (WTP) for a COVID-19 vaccine and its determinants in Indonesia. The WTP was assessed using a simple dichotomous contingent valuation approach and a linear regression model was used to assess its associated determinants. There were 1,359 respondents who completed the survey. In total, 78.3% (1,065) were willing to pay for the COVID-19 vaccine with a mean and median WTP of US$ 57.20 (95%CI: US$ 54.56, US$ 59.85) and US$ 30.94 (95%CI: US$ 30.94, US$ 30.94), respectively. Being a health-care worker, having a high income, and having high perceived risk were associated with higher WTP. These findings suggest that the WTP for a COVID-19 vaccine is relatively high in Indonesia. This WTP information can be used to construct a payment model for a COVID-19 vaccine in the country. Nevertheless, to attain higher vaccine coverage, it may be necessary to partially subsidize the vaccine for those who are less wealthy and to design health promotion materials to increase the perceived risk for COVID-19 in the country.",No potential conflicts of interest were disclosed.,Human Vaccines & Immunotherapeutics,,,2020-09-29,2020,,,1-7,Closed,Article,"Harapan, Harapan; Wagner, Abram L; Yufika, Amanda; Winardi, Wira; Anwar, Samsul; Gan, Alex Kurniawan; Setiawan, Abdul M; Rajamoorthy, Yogambigai; Sofyan, Hizir; Vo, Trung Quang; Hadisoemarto, Panji Fortuna; Müller, Ruth; Groneberg, David A; Mudatsir, Mudatsir","Harapan, Harapan (Medical Research Unit, School of Medicine, Universitas Syiah Kuala , Banda Aceh, Indonesia.; Tropical Disease Centre, School of Medicine, Universitas Syiah Kuala , Banda Aceh, Indonesia.; Department of Microbiology, School of Medicine, Universitas Syiah Kuala , Banda Aceh, Indonesia.); Wagner, Abram L (Department of Epidemiology, University of Michigan , Ann Arbor, MI, USA.); Yufika, Amanda (Department of Family Medicine, School of Medicine, Universitas Syiah Kuala , Banda Aceh, Indonesia.); Winardi, Wira (Department of Pulmonology and Respiratory Medicine, School of Medicine, Universitas Syiah Kuala , Banda Aceh, Indonesia.); Anwar, Samsul (Department of Statistics, Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences, Universitas Syiah Kuala , Banda Aceh, Indonesia.); Gan, Alex Kurniawan (Medical Research Unit, School of Medicine, Universitas Syiah Kuala , Banda Aceh, Indonesia.); Setiawan, Abdul M (Department of Microbiology, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Maulana Malik Ibrahim State Islamic University of Malang , Malang, Indonesia.); Rajamoorthy, Yogambigai (Department of Economics, Faculty of Accountancy and Management, Universiti Tunku Abdul Rahman , Kajang, Malaysia.); Sofyan, Hizir (Department of Statistics, Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences, Universitas Syiah Kuala , Banda Aceh, Indonesia.); Vo, Trung Quang (Department of Economic and Administrative Pharmacy, Faculty of Pharmacy, Pham Ngoc Thach University of Medicine , Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.); Hadisoemarto, Panji Fortuna (Department of Public Health, Faculty of Medicine, Padjadjaran University , Sumedang, Indonesia.); Müller, Ruth (Department Biomedical Sciences, Institute of Tropical Medicine , Antwerp, Belgium.; Department of Tropical Medicine and Public Health, The Institute of Occupational, Social and Environmental Medicine, Goethe University , Frankfurt, Germany.); Groneberg, David A (Department of Tropical Medicine and Public Health, The Institute of Occupational, Social and Environmental Medicine, Goethe University , Frankfurt, Germany.); Mudatsir, Mudatsir (Medical Research Unit, School of Medicine, Universitas Syiah Kuala , Banda Aceh, Indonesia.; Tropical Disease Centre, School of Medicine, Universitas Syiah Kuala , Banda Aceh, Indonesia.; Department of Microbiology, School of Medicine, Universitas Syiah Kuala , Banda Aceh, Indonesia.)",,"Harapan, Harapan (Syiah Kuala University; Syiah Kuala University; Syiah Kuala University); Wagner, Abram L (University of Michigan); Yufika, Amanda (Syiah Kuala University); Winardi, Wira (Syiah Kuala University); Anwar, Samsul (Syiah Kuala University); Gan, Alex Kurniawan (Syiah Kuala University); Setiawan, Abdul M (); Rajamoorthy, Yogambigai (Tunku Abdul Rahman University); Sofyan, Hizir (Syiah Kuala University); Vo, Trung Quang (Pham Ngoc Thach University of Medicine); Hadisoemarto, Panji Fortuna (Padjadjaran University); Müller, Ruth (Institute of Tropical Medicine Antwerp; Goethe University Frankfurt); Groneberg, David A (Goethe University Frankfurt); Mudatsir, Mudatsir (Syiah Kuala University; Syiah Kuala University; Syiah Kuala University)",Goethe University Frankfurt; Syiah Kuala University; Pham Ngoc Thach University of Medicine; University of Michigan; Institute of Tropical Medicine Antwerp; Padjadjaran University; Tunku Abdul Rahman University,grid.7839.5; grid.440768.9; grid.412497.d; grid.214458.e; grid.11505.30; grid.11553.33; grid.412261.2,Germany; Indonesia; Vietnam; United States; Belgium; Indonesia; Malaysia,,0,0,,,1,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1131253345,1117 Public Health and Health Services; 11 Medical and Health Sciences,3 Good Health and Well Being

An anonymous, online, survey of pregnant women (distributed April 3-24, 2020) included a modified pregnancy-related anxiety scale (PRAS) reflecting respondents' perception of pregnancy anxiety before COVID-19 and a current assessment of pregnancy-related anxiety. The difference between these scores was used as the outcome variable. Data were analyzed using bivariate and multivariate linear regression analyses. Two thousand seven hundred forty pregnant women from 47 states completed the survey. 25.8% (N = 706) stopped in-person visits, 15.2% used video visits (N = 415), and 31.8% (N = 817) used phone visits for prenatal care as a result of COVID-19. Those planning a hospital birth dropped from 2641 (96.4%) to 2400 (87.7%) following COVID-19. More than half of women reported increased stress about food running out (59.2%, N = 1622), losing a job or household income (63.7%, N = 1745), or loss of childcare (56.3%, N = 1543). More than a third reported increasing stress about conflict between household members (37.5%, N = 1028), and 93% (N = 2556) reported increased stress about getting infected with COVID-19. Slightly less than half of respondents (either selves or family members) were healthcare workers (41.4%, N = 1133) or worked in essential services (45.5%, N = 1246). In multivariate analysis, those reporting higher agreement with COVID-19-related stressors had greater changes in pre- to post-COVID-19 pregnancy-related anxiety. The COVID-19 pandemic is profoundly affecting pregnant women's mental health, and factors independent of pregnancy appear to be driving changes in pregnancy-specific anxiety.",Not applicable.,Archives of Women's Mental Health,,,2020-09-29,2020,,,1-9,All OA; Gold,Article,"Moyer, Cheryl A.; Compton, Sarah D; Kaselitz, Elizabeth; Muzik, Maria","Moyer, Cheryl A.

In the absence of a “gold standard” treatment, the rapid development of a safe and effective vaccine is considered the most promising way to control the pandemic. In recent years, traditional vaccine technologies have seemed insufficient to provide global protection against the rapid spread of emerging pandemics. Therefore, the establishment of novel approaches that are independent of whole pathogen cultivation, cost-effective, and able to be rapidly developed and produced on a large scale are of paramount importance for global health. This article summarizes the current efforts to develop a COVID-19 vaccine, including the ongoing and future anticipated clinical trials. We also provide plastic and reconstructive surgeons with insight into the novel technologies currently utilized for COVID-19 vaccine development, focusing on the very promising viral-vector-based and gene-based vaccine technologies. Each platform has its own advantages and disadvantages related to its efficacy and ability to induce certain immune responses, manufacturing capacity, and safety for human use.

There are 2.4 billion drinkers (950 million heavy drinkers) and the lifetime prevalence of any alcohol use disorder (AUD) is 5.1%-8.6%. In 2017, global prevalence of alcohol-associated compensated and decompensated cirrhosis was 23.6 million and 2.5 million, respectively. Combined, alcohol-associated cirrhosis and liver cancer account for 1% of all deaths worldwide with this burden expected to increase. Solutions for this growing epidemic must be multi-faceted and focused on both population and patient-level interventions. Reductions in ALD-related morbidity and mortality require solutions that focus on early identification and intervention, reducing alcohol consumption at the population level (taxation, reduced availability and restricted promotion), and solutions tailored to local socioeconomic realities (unrecorded alcohol consumption, focused youth education). Simple screening tools and algorithms can be applied at the population level to identify alcohol misuse, diagnose ALD using non-invasive serum and imaging markers, and risk-stratify higher-risk ALD/AUD patients. Novel methods of healthcare delivery and platforms are needed (telehealth, outreach, use of non-healthcare providers, partnerships between primary and specialty care/tertiary hospitals) to proactively mitigate the global burden of ALD. An integrated approach that combines medical and AUD treatment is needed at the individual level to have the highest impact. Future needs include (1) improving quality of ALD data and standardizing care, (2) supporting innovative healthcare delivery platforms that can treat both ALD and AUD, (3) stronger and concerted advocacy by professional hepatology organizations, and (4) advancing implementation of digital interventions.",,Hepatology,,,2020-09-28,2020,,,,Closed,Article,"Asrani, Sumeet K; Mellinger, Jessica; Arab, Juan P; Shah, Vijay H","Asrani, Sumeet K (Baylor University Medical Center, Dallas, TX, United States); Mellinger, Jessica (Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI); Arab, Juan P (Depto.

The adoption of public health-informed hygienic practices can have a large impact on community transmission of COVID-19 including the wearing of face masks in public settings. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) can be trained to classify people wearing face masks with impressive accuracy. However, current face mask datasets contain clear, high-resolution close-up images of individuals with face masks which is unrepresentative of the lower fidelity images of distant faces more prominent in urban camera images. This paper proposes a practical deep learning computer vision framework for detection and tracking of people in public spaces and the use of face masks. A custom 6,000 image face mask dataset curated from over 50 hours of urban surveillance camera footage is created in this work. CNN-based detectors trained using the dataset are used to perform person detection and face mask classification. Then, a multi-target tracking module extracts individual trajectories from frame-by-frame detection. By associating detected face masks with tracked individuals, overall face mask usage can be estimated. The framework is implemented on several surveillance cameras along the Detroit RiverWalk, a 5-kilometer pedestrian park connecting various greenways, plazas, pavilions, and open green spaces along the Detroit River in Detroit, Michigan. The detection of park user types is shown to have an average precision of 89% and higher for most person classes with the mask detector having an accuracy of 96%. An interactive web application visualizes the data and is used by park managers to inform management decisions and assess strategies used to increase face mask usage rates.","This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. 1831347.

Recently, there has been an increased interest in the hepatic manifestations of coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19). AIM: To describe the demographic and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 positive patients and study the association between transaminitis and all-cause mortality. METHODS: This is a descriptive retrospective cohort study of 130 consecutive patients with a positive COVID PCR test admitted between March 16, 2020 to May 14, 2020 at a tertiary care University-based medical center. The Wilcoxon-rank sum test and paired t-test were used for comparing non-parametric and parametric continuous variables respectively and a multivariable logistic regression models to study the association between transaminitis and mortality using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, United States). RESULTS: Out of the 130 patients, 73 (56%) patients were found to have transaminitis and 57 (44%) did not. When compared to patients without transaminitis, the transaminitis group was found to have a higher median body mass index (30.2 kg/m2 vs 27.3 kg/m2, P = 0.04). In the multivariate analysis those with transaminitis were found to have 3.4 times higher odds of dying as compared to those without transaminitis adjusting for gender, the Age-adjusted Charlson Comorbidity Index and admission to the intensive care unit (P = 0.03). CONCLUSION: Our study showed that transaminitis on admission was associated with severe clinical outcomes such as admission to the intensive care unit, need for mechanical ventilation, and mortality.",,World Journal of Hepatology,,,2020-09-27,2020,12,9,619-627,All OA; Gold,Article,"Suresh Kumar, Vishnu Charan; Harne, Prateek Suresh; Mukherjee, Samiran; Gupta, Kashvi; Masood, Umair; Sharma, Anuj Vikrant; Lamichhane, Jivan; Dhamoon, Amit Singh; Sapkota, Bishnu","Suresh Kumar, Vishnu Charan (Department of Internal Medicine, SUNY Upstate Medical University, Syracuse, NY 13202, United States. drvishnucharan@gmail.com.); Harne, Prateek Suresh (Department of Internal Medicine, SUNY Upstate Medical University, Syracuse, NY 13202, United States.); Mukherjee, Samiran (Department of Internal Medicine, SUNY Upstate Medical University, Syracuse, NY 13202, United States.); Gupta, Kashvi (Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, United States.); Masood, Umair (Division of Gastroenterology, SUNY Upstate Medical University, Syracuse, NY 13202, United States.); Sharma, Anuj Vikrant (Division of Gastroenterology, SUNY Upstate Medical University, Syracuse, NY 13202, United States.); Lamichhane, Jivan (Department of Internal Medicine, SUNY Upstate Medical University, Syracuse, NY 13202, United States.); Dhamoon, Amit Singh (Department of Internal Medicine, SUNY Upstate Medical University, Syracuse, NY 13202, United States.); Sapkota, Bishnu (Division of Gastroenterology, SUNY Upstate Medical University, Syracuse, NY 13202, United States.)",,"Suresh Kumar, Vishnu Charan (SUNY Upstate Medical University); Harne, Prateek Suresh (SUNY Upstate Medical University); Mukherjee, Samiran (SUNY Upstate Medical University); Gupta, Kashvi (University of Michigan); Masood, Umair (SUNY Upstate Medical University); Sharma, Anuj Vikrant (SUNY Upstate Medical University); Lamichhane, Jivan (SUNY Upstate Medical University); Dhamoon, Amit Singh (SUNY Upstate Medical University); Sapkota, Bishnu (SUNY Upstate Medical University)",University of Michigan; SUNY Upstate Medical University,grid.214458.e; grid.411023.5,United States; United States,,0,0,,,1,https://doi.org/10.4254/wjh.v12.i9.619,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1130999847,11 Medical and Health Sciences; 1103 Clinical Sciences,3 Good Health and Well Being

Obesity has been associated with increased disease severity in COVID-19, and obesity is strongly associated with hepatic steatosis (HS). However, how HS alters the natural history of COVID-19 is not well characterized, especially in Western populations. AIMS: To characterize the impact of HS on disease severity and liver injury in COVID-19. METHODS: We examined the association between HS and disease severity in a single-center cohort study of hospitalized COVID-19 patients at Michigan Medicine. HS was defined by either hepatic steatosis index > 36 (for Asians) or > 39 (for non-Asians) or liver imaging demonstrating steatosis > 30 days before onset of COVID-19. The primary predictor was HS. The primary outcomes were severity of cardiopulmonary disease, transaminitis, jaundice, and portal hypertensive complications. RESULTS: In a cohort of 342 patients, metabolic disease was highly prevalent including nearly 90% overweight. HS was associated with increased transaminitis and need for intubation, dialysis, and vasopressors. There was no association between HS and jaundice or portal hypertensive complications. In a sensitivity analysis including only patients with liver imaging > 30 days before onset of COVID-19, imaging evidence of hepatic steatosis remained associated with disease severity and risk of transaminitis. CONCLUSIONS: HS was associated with increased disease severity and transaminitis in COVID-19.

Herein, systems biology approaches were utilized to elucidate how pregnancy modulates tissue-specific host responses to a bacterial product, endotoxin. Methods Pregnant and non-pregnant mice were injected with endotoxin or saline on 16.5 days post coitum (n=8-11 per group). The uterus, cervix, liver, adrenal gland, kidney, lung, and brain were collected 12 h after injection and transcriptomes were measured using microarrays. Heatmaps and principal component analysis were used for visualization. Differentially expressed genes between groups were assessed using linear models that included interaction terms to determine whether the effect of infection differed with pregnancy status. Pathway analysis was conducted to interpret gene expression changes. Results We report herein a multi-organ atlas of the transcript perturbations in pregnant and non-pregnant mice in response to endotoxin. Pregnancy strongly modified the host responses to endotoxin in the uterus, cervix, and liver. In contrast, pregnancy had a milder effect on the host response to endotoxin in the adrenal gland, lung, and kidney. However, pregnancy did not drastically affect the host response to endotoxin in the brain. Conclusions Pregnancy imprints organ-specific host immune responses upon endotoxin exposure. These findings provide insight into the host-response against microbes during pregnancy.",,Journal of Perinatal Medicine,,,2020-09-25,2020,48,7,700-722,Closed,Article,"Motomura, Kenichiro; Romero, Roberto;

This study examined differences in the prevalence of psychiatric disorders, their persistence, and unmet treatment needs among Black women in the U.S. Data were from the National Survey of American Life, a nationally representative survey that assessed lifetime and twelve-month mood, anxiety, and substance use disorders according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 4th Edition (DSM-IV) criteria, and mental health service use among those meeting disorder criteria. One in three African American women met criteria for a lifetime disorder, compared to one in three Caribbean women born within the U.S. and one in five Caribbean women born outside the U.S. About half of African American women with a lifetime disorder had a persistent psychiatric disorder, compared to two in five Caribbean women born within the U.S. and two in three Caribbean women born outside the U.S. African Americans had more persisting dysthymia and panic disorder and less persisting social phobia compared to foreign-born Caribbean women. Of the three groups, Caribbean women born within the U.S. were most likely to seek mental health treatment during their lifetime. These results demonstrate, despite a lower prevalence of psychiatric disorders in Black women, that there is a great likelihood their disorders will be marked by persistence and underscores the need for culturally specific treatment approaches.

In the United States (U.S.), Latinx immigrants and other minorities have experienced greater economic burden and worse health outcomes, resulting in alarming rates of death from COVID-19. Yet the government’s relief measures to support individuals did not extend to millions of immigrants. This left many immigrants with the cruel choice to either stay home to protect themselves and their loved ones from the virus or go to work to support their families. Disregard for a large segment of the population is further complemented by strict immigration policies, harsher border restrictions, and public health guidelines that failed to account for the realities faced by immigrants. In this brief, we highlight the unequal toll of the COVID-19 pandemic on immigrants and consider social work response. We argue that the pandemic demands more of the social work profession, as the coronavirus crisis exposed more clearly the systemic inequalities toward immigrants and aggravates their vulnerabilities. Insofar as systems are unequal and racist in the context of coronavirus, there is a great need for social work response that is innovative, brave, and deeply connected to communities.",,Affilia,,,2020-09-25,2020,,,088610992096083,All OA; Gold,Article,"Cross, Fernanda L.; Gonzalez Benson, Odessa","Cross, Fernanda L.

In order to safely care for patients new processes, such as a plan for the airway management of a patient with COVID-19, must be implemented and disseminated in a rapid fashion. The use of in-situ simulation has been used to assist in latent problem identification as part of a Plan-Do-Study-Act cycle. Additionally, simulation is an effective means for training teams to perform high-risk procedures before engaging in the actual procedure. This educational advance seeks to use and study in-situ simulation as a means to rapidly implement a process for airway management in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: Using an airway algorithm developed by the authors, we designed an in-situ simulation scenario to train physicians, nurses, and respiratory therapists in best practices for airway management of patients with COVID-19. Physician participants were surveyed using a five-point Likert scale with regard to their comfort level with various aspects of the airway algorithm both before and after the simulation in a retrospective fashion. Additionally, we obtained feedback from all participants and used it to refine the airway algorithm. RESULTS: Over a two-week period, 93 physicians participated in the simulation. We received 81 responses to the survey (87%), which showed that the average level of comfort with personal protective equipment procedures increased significantly from 2.94 (95% confidence interval, 2.71-3.17) to 4.36 (4.24-4.48), a difference of 1.42 (1.20-1.63, p < 0.001). There was a significant increase in average comfort level in understanding the physician role with scores increasing from 3.51 (3.26-3.77) to 4.55 (2.71-3.17), a difference of 1.04 (0.82-1.25, p < 0.001). There was also increased comfort in performing procedural tasks such as intubation, from 3.08 (2.80-3.35) to 4.38 (4.23-4.52) after the simulation, a difference of 1.30 points (1.06-1.54, p < 0.001). Feedback from the participants also led to refinement of the airway algorithm. CONCLUSION: We successfully implemented a new airway management guideline for patients with suspected COVID-19. In-situ simulation is an essential tool for both dissemination and onboarding, as well as process improvement, in the context of an epidemic or pandemic.",,Western Journal of Emergency Medicine,,,2020-09-24,2020,0,0,,All OA; Gold,Article,"Munzer, Brendan W; Bassin, Benjamin S; Peterson, William J; Tucker, Ryan V; Doan, Jessica; Harvey, Carrie; Sefa, Nana; Hsu, Cindy H","Munzer, Brendan W (Michigan Medicine, Department of Emergency Medicine, Ann Arbor, Michigan.; Michigan Medicine, Department of Emergency Medicine, Ann Arbor, Michigan.; Michigan Center for Integrative Research in Critical Care, Ann Arbor, Michigan.); Bassin, Benjamin S (Michigan Medicine, Department of Emergency Medicine, Ann Arbor, Michigan.; Michigan Center for Integrative Research in Critical Care, Ann Arbor, Michigan.; Michigan Medicine, Department of Emergency Medicine, Ann Arbor, Michigan.; Michigan Center for Integrative Research in Critical Care, Ann Arbor, Michigan.); Peterson, William J (Michigan Medicine, Department of Emergency Medicine, Ann Arbor, Michigan.; Michigan Medicine, Department of Emergency Medicine, Ann Arbor, Michigan.; Michigan Center for Integrative Research in Critical Care, Ann Arbor, Michigan.); Tucker, Ryan V (Michigan Medicine, Department of Emergency Medicine, Ann Arbor, Michigan.; Michigan Medicine, Department of Emergency Medicine, Ann Arbor, Michigan.; Michigan Center for Integrative Research in Critical Care, Ann Arbor, Michigan.); Doan, Jessica (Michigan Medicine, Department of Emergency Medicine, Ann Arbor, Michigan.; Michigan Medicine, Department of Emergency Medicine, Ann Arbor, Michigan.; Michigan Center for Integrative Research in Critical Care, Ann Arbor, Michigan.); Harvey, Carrie (Michigan Medicine, Department of Emergency Medicine, Ann Arbor, Michigan.; Michigan Medicine, Department of Emergency Medicine, Ann Arbor, Michigan.; Michigan Center for Integrative Research in Critical Care, Ann Arbor, Michigan.); Sefa, Nana (Michigan Medicine, Department of Emergency Medicine, Ann Arbor, Michigan.; Michigan Medicine, Department of Emergency Medicine, Ann Arbor, Michigan.; Michigan Center for Integrative Research in Critical Care, Ann Arbor, Michigan.); Hsu, Cindy H (Michigan Medicine, Department of Emergency Medicine, Ann Arbor, Michigan.; Michigan Center for Integrative Research in Critical Care, Ann Arbor, Michigan.; Michigan Medicine, Department of Emergency Medicine, Ann Arbor, Michigan.; Michigan Center for Integrative Research in Critical Care, Ann Arbor, Michigan.)",,"Munzer, Brendan W (Michigan Medicine); Bassin, Benjamin S (Michigan Medicine); Peterson, William J (Michigan Medicine); Tucker, Ryan V (Michigan Medicine); Doan, Jessica (Michigan Medicine); Harvey, Carrie (Michigan Medicine); Sefa, Nana (Michigan Medicine); Hsu, Cindy H (Michigan Medicine)",Michigan Medicine,grid.412590.b,United States,National Heart Lung and Blood Institute,0,0,,,,https://doi.org/10.5811/westjem.2020.7.48159,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1131796044,1117 Public Health and Health Services; 11 Medical and Health Sciences,

Barriers to delivering efficient health care include geographical limitations as well as long wait times. Telehealth has been used as a solution by many different health care services. However, it has not been as widely used in cancer care. In 2018, the US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Pittsburgh Healthcare System expanded the use of telehealth to provide antineoplastic therapies to rural patients by creating a clinical video telehealth clinic of the Virtual Cancer Care Network. This allows oncologists located at the tertiary center to virtually deliver care to remote sites. The recent COVID-19 pandemic forced oncologists across the VA system to adopt telehealth to provide continuity of care. On the basis of our review and personal experience, we have outlined opportunities for telehealth to play a role in every step of the cancer care journey from diagnosis to therapy to surveillance to clinical trials for medical, surgical, and radiation oncology. There are many advantages, such as decreased travel time and potential cost savings; however, there continues to be challenges with veterans having access to devices and the Internet as well as understanding how to use telehealth equipment. The lessons learned from this assessment of the VA telehealth system for cancer care can be adopted and integrated into other health systems. In the future, there needs to be evaluation of how telehealth can be further incorporated into oncology, satisfaction of veterans using telehealth services, overcoming telehealth barriers, and defining metrics of success.",,,,,2020-09-24,2020,,,op2000520,Closed,Article,"Jiang, Cindy Y; El-Kouri, Nadeem T; Elliot, David; Shields, Jenna; Caram, Megan E V; Frankel, Timothy L; Ramnath, Nithya; Passero, Vida A","Jiang, Cindy Y (Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI.); El-Kouri, Nadeem T (VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System, Pittsburgh, PA.); Elliot, David (Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI.); Shields, Jenna (VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System, Pittsburgh, PA.); Caram, Megan E V (Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan Rogel Cancer Center, Ann Arbor, MI.; VA Ann Arbor Healthcare System, Ann Arbor, MI.); Frankel, Timothy L (Division of Surgical Oncology, Department of Surgery, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI.); Ramnath, Nithya (Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan Rogel Cancer Center, Ann Arbor, MI.; VA Ann Arbor Healthcare System, Ann Arbor, MI.); Passero, Vida A (VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System, Pittsburgh, PA.)",,"Jiang, Cindy Y (University of Michigan); El-Kouri, Nadeem T (VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System); Elliot, David (University of Michigan); Shields, Jenna (VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System); Caram, Megan E V (University of Michigan; VA Ann Arbor Healthcare System); Frankel, Timothy L (University of Michigan); Ramnath, Nithya (University of Michigan; VA Ann Arbor Healthcare System); Passero, Vida A (VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System)",VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System; VA Ann Arbor Healthcare System; University of Michigan,grid.413935.9; grid.413800.e; grid.214458.e,United States; United States; United States,,0,0,,,6,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1131170567,08 Information and Computing Sciences; 1117 Public Health and Health Services; 11 Medical and Health Sciences; 0806 Information Systems,3 Good Health and Well Being

METHODS: All employees were invited to participate in a questionnaire and serological survey to detect antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 as part of a facility-wide quality improvement and infection prevention initiative regardless of clinical or nonclinical duties. The initiative was conducted from June 8 to July 8, 2020. RESULTS: Of the 2,900 employees, 51% participated in the study, revealing a positive SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence of 4.9% (72 of 1,476; 95% CI, 3.8%-6.1%). There were no statistically significant differences in the presence of antibody based on gender, age, frontline worker status, job title, performance of aerosol-generating procedures, or exposure to known patients with coronavirus infectious disease 2019 (COVID-19) within the hospital. Employees who reported exposure to a known COVID-19 case outside work had a significantly higher seroprevalence at 14.8% (23 of 155) compared to those who did not 3.7% (48 of 1,296; OR, 4.53; 95% CI, 2.67-7.68; P < .0001). Notably, 29% of seropositive employees reported no history of symptoms for SARS-CoV-2 infection. CONCLUSIONS: The seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 among employees was not significantly different among those who provided direct patient care and those who did not, suggesting that facility-wide infection control measures were effective. Employees who reported direct personal contact with COVID-19-positive persons outside work were more likely to have SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.

Other forms of acute lung injury, including organizing pneumonia, and acute fibrinous and organizing pneumonia are seen. Acute neutrophilic infiltrates have been observed, most frequently as the manifestation of a superimposed bacterial pneumonia. SARS-CoV-2 has been detected in type I and type II pneumocytes and bronchial epithelial cells using electron microscopy, immunohistochemistry, and in situ hybridization, and likewise, viral transcripts were localized with RNA probes in pneumocytes. However, the presence of true viral cytopathic effect seen with light microscopy remains to be defined. Interestingly, vascular changes are frequently observed in association with DAD, which include severe endothelial injury/endothelialitis, hemorrhage, and thrombotic and microangiopathic vasculopathy. Since similar vascular changes also occur in cases of DAD independent of the etiology, whether the vascular pathology in COVID lungs has unique features and represents a separate pathologic process is under investigation.",,Cleveland Clinic Journal of Medicine,,,2020-09-23,2020,,,,All OA; Gold,Article,"Arrossi, Andrea Valeria; Farver, Carol","Arrossi, Andrea Valeria (Department of Pathology, Cleveland Clinic arrossa@ccf.org.); Farver, Carol (Department of Pathology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan.)",,"Arrossi, Andrea Valeria (); Farver, Carol (University of Michigan)",University of Michigan,grid.214458.e,United States,,1,1,,,2,https://www.ccjm.org/content/ccjom/early/2020/09/18/ccjm.87a.ccc063.full.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1131132395,1102 Cardiorespiratory Medicine and Haematology; 11 Medical and Health Sciences,

These two male patients, one aged 59-years and another aged 53-years, both with a history of hypertension and neurologically intact on admission, developed worsening COVID-19 associated acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Both required benzodiazepine, opioid, neuromuscular blockade, therapeutic anticoagulation, and vasopressor infusions in addition to renal replacement therapy. Echocardiography demonstrated normal chamber size and systolic function in both cases. Each patient demonstrated only trace flexion to pain 7-10 days following discontinuation of all sedation. Magnetic Resonance Imaging on both patients demonstrated multifocal lesions on diffusion weighted imaging with apparent diffusion coefficient correlate in bilateral middle/anterior cerebral artery borderzones, and no large-vessel occlusion or severe stenosis. In both patients, continuous electroencephalography demonstrated no seizures. Neither patient had any documented period of sustained hypotension (mean arterial pressure <60 mmHg) or hypoxia (SpO2 <90%). Ninety days following initial presentation, the 59-years-old man was oriented, with fluent speech and able to ambulate with assistance, while the other 53-years-old man was at home and independent, undertaking the basic activities required by daily living. We conclude that critically-ill COVID-19 patients with prolonged coma following sedation discontinuation may demonstrate imaging features of ischemic injury in borderzone regions despite the absence of documented sustained hypotension or hypoxia.

We sought to understand the effects of CDK4/6 inhibition (CDK4/6i) and radiation (RT) in multiple preclinical breast cancer models. METHODS: Transcriptomic and proteomic analyses were used to identify significantly altered pathways after CDK4/6i. Clonogenic assays were used to quantify the RT enhancement ratio (rER). DNA damage was quantified using γH2AX staining and the neutral comet assay. DNA repair was assessed using RAD51 foci formation and non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) reporter assays. Orthotopic xenografts were used to assess the efficacy of combination therapy. RESULTS: Palbociclib significantly radiosensitized multiple ER+ cell lines at low nanomolar, sub IC50 concentrations (rER: 1.21 - 1.52) and led to a decrease in the surviving fraction of cells at 2 Gy (p < 0.001). Similar results were observed in ribociclib- (rER: 1.08 - 1.68) and abemaciclib-treated (rER: 1.19 - 2.05) cells. Combination treatment decreased RAD51 foci formation (p < 0.001), leading to a suppression of HR activity, but did not affect NHEJ efficiency (p > 0.05).

This review addresses gaps in the literature regarding posttracheostomy care, emphasizing safety of multidisciplinary teams, coordinating complex care needs, and identifying and managing late complications of prolonged intubation and tracheostomy. DATA SOURCES: PubMed, Cochrane Library, Scopus, Google Scholar, institutional guidance documents. REVIEW METHODS: Literature through June 2020 on the care of patients with a tracheostomy was reviewed, including consensus statements, clinical practice guidelines, institutional guidance, and scientific literature on COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 virology and immunology. Where data were lacking, expert opinions were aggregated and adjudicated to arrive at consensus recommendations. CONCLUSIONS: Best practices in caring for patients after a tracheostomy during the COVID-19 pandemic are multifaceted, encompassing precautions during aerosol-generating procedures; minimizing exposure risks to health care workers, caregivers, and patients; ensuring safe, timely tracheostomy care; and identifying and managing laryngotracheal injury, such as vocal fold injury, posterior glottic stenosis, and subglottic stenosis that may affect speech, swallowing, and airway protection. We present recommended approaches to tracheostomy care, outlining modifications to conventional algorithms, raising vigilance for heightened risks of bleeding or other complications, and offering recommendations for personal protective equipment, equipment, care protocols, and personnel. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Treatment of patients with a tracheostomy in the COVID-19 pandemic requires foresight and may rival procedural considerations in tracheostomy in their complexity. By considering patient-specific factors, mitigating transmission risks, optimizing the clinical environment, and detecting late manifestations of severe COVID-19, clinicians can ensure due vigilance and quality care.",,Otolaryngology,,,2020-09-22,2020,,,194599820961990,All OA;

METHOD: A total of 984 participants completed a self-administered online questionnaire. RESULTS: Over 90% were healthy (i.e., not in a high-risk health-related group for COVID-19), did not have COVID-19 symptoms within 30 d, and always/frequently engaged in preventive measures. Fifty-eight percent thought that they had a 0% to 25% chance of having immunity/antibodies to COVID-19. Non-dental health care workers thought that their chance was significantly higher (P < 0.05) than others. Over 70% were sometimes, frequently, or always worried about their friends and loved ones getting COVID-19 and of resulting financial problems. Dental workers were significantly less afraid than non-dental health care and non-health care providers. For all groups, more than half of the respondents stated that the pandemic had a negative (somewhat worse or worse) impact on daily life (59%), interactions with others (65%), stress levels (66%), and enjoyment of life (56%). There were significant differences among all 3 groups regarding the percentage of individuals with a negative impact on job security (dental, 47%; non-dental health care, 34%; non-health care, 31%). However, more than half of the respondents stated that the pandemic had a positive impact (same, somewhat better, or much better) on caring about one another, self-care, and exercise. Knowing the results of an antibody test would decrease the level of stress and anxiety in 67% of respondents. Over 80% found a COVID-19 test received in a dental setting acceptable, were ""definitely"" satisfied, and would ""definitely"" recommend it to a friend, family, or coworker. CONCLUSIONS: These findings support that dental workers are as vulnerable as other essential workers to threats and psychological impacts of COVID-19. They also support the acceptability and satisfaction of testing for a pandemic done in a dental setting. KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER STATEMENT: The results of this study highlight the impact that pandemics such as COVID-19 can have on life experiences of essential workers, including dentists. It also highlights a role that dentistry can play within the broader health care system, during and beyond the current pandemic, to help with surveillance efforts of community health. Testing may also help alleviate stress and anxiety associated with these pandemics.","Many thanks to the dentists responsible for administering the COVID tests and research questionnaire: Michael Britt, Greg Czarnecki, Robert Green, Howard Hamerink, Don Heys, Darnell Kaigler, Elisabeta Karl, Justin Krasnoff, John Krezel, Ray Maturo, Laurie McClatchey, Laurence Miller, Andrea Pobocik, Therese Shortt, Steve Stefanac, Peter Yaman, and Najla Kasebreh.

When physicians move between differing practice environments learners may encounter situations for which they are unprepared. Using a conceptual framework specific to the LE, we therefore asked the following research question: what is the difference in LE for Navy emergency medicine (EM) physicians who practice in U.S. hospitals but serve an operational environment, and how do these differences shape their learning needs? We interviewed Navy EM physicians who recently deployed to explore their perceptions of the deployed LE, how it differed from the LE they practice in stateside, and the perceived effect this difference had on their learning needs. We used the constant comparative method to gather and analyze data until thematic saturation was achieved. We interviewed 12 physicians and identified six interconnected themes consistent with the LE framework in the literature: 1) patient care is central to the learning experience; 2) professional isolation versus connectedness; 3) a sense of meaningful practice engages the learner in the LE; 4) physicians as educators shape the LE; 5) team trust impacts the LE; and 6) the larger military organization impacts the LE. Our themes span the conceptual framework put forth by previous work and did not find themes outside this framework. These interconnected themes describe the difference in LE between the stateside and deployed setting and impact the learning needs of Navy EM physicians.

Approaches that draw on psychoanalytic thinking to support frontline nurses' mental health are explained. METHOD: This article draws on recent work that is available from multiple sources, including published journal articles on moral injury, recent reports from news services highlighting the crisis state of the pandemic and effects on nurses, established literature on the structural model of the mind, and recent webinars and online lectures addressing mental health crisis interventions. The author draws on expertise from years of training in the Adult Psychoanalytic Training Program at the Michigan Psychoanalytic Institute and graduation as an academic analyst. RESULTS: How nurses navigate moral hazards inherent in the current state of frontline health care may depend on their existing ego strengths and levels of self-blame and guilt from a harsh superego. CONCLUSIONS: Mental health professionals need to be aware of the mental minefields that frontline nurses must navigate when providing care that, due to circumstances beyond their control, may be morally ambiguous.

39,pub.1130097481,10.1126/science.aay4497,32792461,,The ecological and evolutionary consequences of systemic racism in urban environments,"Urban areas are dynamic ecological systems defined by interdependent biological, physical, and social components. The emergent structure and heterogeneity of urban landscapes drives biotic outcomes in these areas, and such spatial patterns are often attributed to the unequal stratification of wealth and power in human societies. Despite these patterns, few studies have effectively considered structural inequalities as drivers of ecological and evolutionary outcomes and have instead focused on indicator variables such as neighborhood wealth. In this analysis, we explicitly integrate ecology, evolution, and social processes to emphasize the relationships that bind social inequities-specifically racism-and biological change in urbanized landscapes. We draw on existing research to link racist practices, including residential segregation, to the heterogeneous patterns of flora and fauna observed by urban ecologists. In the future, urban ecology and evolution researchers must consider how systems of racial oppression affect the environmental factors that drive biological change in cities. Conceptual integration of the social and ecological sciences has amassed considerable scholarship in urban ecology over the past few decades, providing a solid foundation for incorporating environmental justice scholarship into urban ecological and evolutionary research. Such an undertaking is necessary to deconstruct urbanization's biophysical patterns and processes, inform equitable and anti-racist initiatives promoting justice in urban conservation, and strengthen community resilience to global environmental change.","S.D.R., C.J.S., C.A.W.-E. and D.S.M. were funded by the University of Washington.

Thus, the health and well-being of family caregivers have attracted widespread attention. Mobile health technology has been shown to deliver flexible, and time- and cost-sparing interventions to support family caregivers across the care trajectory. OBJECTIVE: This protocol aims to leverage technology to deliver a novel caregiver-facing mobile health intervention named Roadmap 2.0. We will evaluate the effectiveness of Roadmap 2.0 in family caregivers of patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. METHODS: The Roadmap 2.0 intervention will consist of a mobile randomized trial comparing a positive psychology intervention arm with a control arm in family caregiver-patient dyads. The primary outcome will be caregiver health-related quality of life, as assessed by the PROMIS Global Health scale at day 120 post-transplant. Secondary outcomes will include other PROMIS caregiver- and patient-reported outcomes, including companionship, self-efficacy for managing symptoms, self-efficacy for managing daily activities, positive affect and well-being, sleep disturbance, depression, and anxiety. Semistructured qualitative interviews will be conducted among participants at the completion of the study. We will also measure objective physiological markers (eg, sleep, activity, heart rate) through wearable wrist sensors and health care utilization data through electronic health records. RESULTS: We plan to enroll 166 family caregiver-patient dyads for the full data analysis. The study has received Institutional Review Board approval as well as Code Review and Information Assurance approval from our health information technology services. Owing to the COVID-19 pandemic, the study has been briefly put on hold. However, recruitment began in August 2020. We have converted all recruitment, enrollment, and onboarding processes to be conducted remotely through video telehealth. Consent will be obtained electronically through the Roadmap 2.0 app. CONCLUSIONS: This mobile randomized trial will determine if positive psychology-based activities delivered through mobile health technology can improve caregiver health-related quality of life over a 16-week study period. This study will provide additional data on the effects of wearable wrist sensors on caregiver and patient self-report outcomes.

In this work, we reported the CFR of 53 countries or regions with the highest COVID-19 death tolls. Of them, 43 had lower CFR estimates in the ongoing second wave than in the first wave. We discussed the possible reasons. Also, we compared the two-wave pattern of COVID-19 with those of influenza.

This adaptability is lost in cultured adult endothelial cells, which do not vascularize tissues in an organotypic manner. Here, we show that transient reactivation of the embryonic-restricted ETS variant transcription factor 2 (ETV2)3 in mature human endothelial cells cultured in a serum-free three-dimensional matrix composed of a mixture of laminin, entactin and type-IV collagen (LEC matrix) 'resets' these endothelial cells to adaptable, vasculogenic cells, which form perfusable and plastic vascular plexi. Through chromatin remodelling, ETV2 induces tubulogenic pathways, including the activation of RAP1, which promotes the formation of durable lumens4,5. In three-dimensional matrices-which do not have the constraints of bioprinted scaffolds-the 'reset' vascular endothelial cells (R-VECs) self-assemble into stable, multilayered and branching vascular networks within scalable microfluidic chambers, which are capable of transporting human blood. In vivo, R-VECs implanted subcutaneously in mice self-organize into durable pericyte-coated vessels that functionally anastomose to the host circulation and exhibit long-lasting patterning, with no evidence of malformations or angiomas. R-VECs directly interact with cells within three-dimensional co-cultured organoids, removing the need for the restrictive synthetic semipermeable membranes that are required for organ-on-chip systems, therefore providing a physiological platform for vascularization, which we call 'Organ-On-VascularNet'. R-VECs enable perfusion of glucose-responsive insulin-secreting human pancreatic islets, vascularize decellularized rat intestines and arborize healthy or cancerous human colon organoids. Using single-cell RNA sequencing and epigenetic profiling, we demonstrate that R-VECs establish an adaptive vascular niche that differentially adjusts and conforms to organoids and tumoroids in a tissue-specific manner. Our Organ-On-VascularNet model will permit metabolic, immunological and physiochemical studies and screens to decipher the crosstalk between organotypic endothelial cells and parenchymal cells for identification of determinants of endothelial cell heterogeneity, and could lead to advances in therapeutic organ repair and tumour targeting.","S.R. is supported by the Ansary Stem Cell Institute; grants from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) (R35 HL150809, R01s DK095039, HL119872, HL128158, HL115128, HL139056, RC2 DK114777 and U01AI138329); the Empire State Stem Cell Board; grants from New York State Stem Cell Science (NYSTEM) (C026878, C028117, C029156, C030160); the Daedalus Fund for Innovation from Weill Cornell Medicine; and the Starr Foundation stem cell core project; and Qatar National Priorities Research Program (NPRP 8-1898-3-392); and the Tri-Institutional Stem Cell Initiatives (TRI-SCI 2013-032, 2014-023, 2016-013 and 2019-029).

A systematic search was performed in 5 electronic databases (PubMed, Embase, LILACS, Scopus, and Web of Science). Studies were eligible for inclusion if they assessed the potential diagnostic value and/or other discriminatory properties of biological markers in the saliva of patients with COVID-19. As of July 22, 2020, a total of 28 studies have investigated the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in saliva. Several of those studies confirmed reliable detection of SARS-CoV-2 in the saliva of patients with COVID-19. Saliva offered sensitivity and specificity for SARS-CoV-2 detection comparable to that of the current standard of nasopharyngeal and throat swabs. However, the utility of saliva in diagnosing COVID-19 infection remains understudied. Clinical studies with larger patient populations that measure recordings at different stages during the disease are still necessary to confirm the accuracy of COVID-19 diagnosis with saliva. Nevertheless, the utility of saliva as a diagnostic tool opens the possibility of using rapid and less invasive diagnostic strategies by targeting bioanalytes rather than the pathogen.",,Journal of Dental Research,,,2020-09-16,2020,,,22034520960070,All OA; Gold,Article,"Fernandes, L.L.; Pacheco, V.B.; Borges, L.; Athwal, H.K.; de Paula Eduardo, F.; Bezinelli, L.; Correa, L.; Jimenez, M.; Dame-Teixeira, N.; Lombaert, I.M.A.; Heller, D.","Fernandes, L.L.

We stand on the shoulders of the giants and will not forget their examples and their teachings. We will work to the best of our ability to honor their memory. Professor Harvey Cushing said: ""When to take great risks; when to withdraw in the face of unexpected difficulties; whether to force an attempted enucleation of a pathologically favorable tumor to its completion with the prospect of an operative fatality, or to abandon the procedure short of completeness with the certainty that after months or years even greater risks may have to be faced at a subsequent session-all these require surgical judgment which is a matter of long experience."" It is up to us, therefore, to keep on the noble path that we have decided to undertake, to accumulate the surgical experience that these icons have shown us, the fruit of sacrifice and obstinacy. Our tribute goes to them; we will always remember their excellent work and their brilliant careers that will continue to enlighten all of us.",,Neurosurgery,,"Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; History, 21st Century; Humans; Neurosurgery; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral",2020-09-15,2020,87,4,nyaa314-,"All OA; Green, Published",Article,"Chaurasia, Bipin; Deora, Harsh; El-Ghandour, Nasser M F; Oyesiku, Nelson M; Chaurasia, Raushan Kumar; Schulder, Michael; Sanchez, Jose Antonio Soriano; Teo, Mario; Hernesniemi, Juha; Linzey, Joseph Raynor; Schwartz, Theodore H; Cohen-Gadol, Aaron A; Lawton, Michael; Umana, Giuseppe; Mura, Jorge; Grotenhuis, Andre; Sinha, Ajit K; Schroeder, Henry W S; Natarajan, Sabareesh; Sughrue, Michael E; Spetzler, Robert F; Drummond, Katharine; Tanikawa, Rokuya; do Seixo Kadri, Paulo Abdo; Kato, Yoko; Teo, Charles; Suri, Ashish; Tomasi, Santino Ottavio; Winkler, Peter A; Scalia, Gianluca; Sampron, Nicolas; Rasulic, Lukas; Cappabianca, Paolo; Fontanella, Marco M; Laws, Edward R","Chaurasia, Bipin (Department of Neurosurgery, Neurosurgery Clinic, Birgunj, Nepal); Deora, Harsh (Department of Neurosurgery, National Institute of Mental Health and Neuroscience, Bangalore, Karnataka, India); El-Ghandour, Nasser M F (Department of Neurosurgery, Faculty of Medicine, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt); Oyesiku, Nelson M (Department of Neurosurgery, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia); Chaurasia, Raushan Kumar (LVR Klinik, Duren, Germany); Schulder, Michael (Department of Neurosurgery, Brain Tumor Center Zucker School of Medicine, Hofstra/Northwell, North Shore University Hospital, Manhasset, New York); Sanchez, Jose Antonio Soriano (Neurological Centre, ABC Medical Center, Mexico City, Mexico); Teo, Mario (Bristol Institute of Clinical Neuroscience, Bristol University Hospital, Bristol, United Kingdom); Hernesniemi, Juha (Henan Provincial People's Hospital, Zhengzhou, China); Linzey, Joseph Raynor (Department of Neurosurgery, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan); Schwartz, Theodore H (Department of Neurosurgery, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York Presbyterian Hospital, New York, New York); Cohen-Gadol, Aaron A (Department of Neurosurgery, Indiana University.

To address this gap, we developed a CI track to facilitate advanced training for senior residents at our 4‐year emergency medicine residency. We piloted an affordable project‐based approach with strong ties to operational leadership at our institution and describe specific projects and their outcomes. Given the relatively low cost, departmental benefit, and unique educational value, we believe that our model is generalizable to many emergency medicine residencies.

We characterized risk perceptions and adherence to social distancing recommendations in March 2020 among US adults aged 18+ in an online survey with age and gender quotas to match the general US population (N = 713). We used multivariable logistic and linear regression to estimate associations between age (by generational cohort) and these outcomes. The median perceived risk of infection with COVID-19 within the next month was 32%, and 65% of individuals were practicing more social distancing than before the outbreak. Baby Boomers had lower perceived risk than Millennials (-10.6%, 95% CI: -16.2%, -5.0%), yet were more frequently social distancing (OR = 1.64; 95% CI: 1.05, 2.56). Public health outreach should focus on raising compliance with social distancing recommendations, especially among high risk groups. Efforts to address risk perceptions alone may be inadequate.","This project was supported by an award to ALW the National Institute Of Allergy And Infectious Diseases of the National Institutes of Health under Award Number K01AI137123 (https://www.niaid.nih.gov/).

Measures to mitigate the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused widespread changes in human activity, leading to a months-long reduction in seismic noise of up to 50%. The 2020 seismic noise quiet period is the longest and most prominent global anthropogenic seismic noise reduction on record. Although the reduction is strongest at surface seismometers in populated areas, this seismic quiescence extends for many kilometers radially and hundreds of meters in depth. This quiet period provides an opportunity to detect subtle signals from subsurface seismic sources that would have been concealed in noisier times and to benchmark sources of anthropogenic noise. A strong correlation between seismic noise and independent measurements of human mobility suggests that seismology provides an absolute, real-time estimate of human activities.","P.K. was funded by a Royal Society University Research Fellowship (URF\R1\180377).

However, the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon remain unclear. In this Review, we discuss vascular intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms of how ageing influences the pathology of atherosclerosis. First, we focus on factors that are extrinsic to the vasculature. We discuss how ageing affects the development of myeloid cells leading to the expansion of certain myeloid cell clones and induces changes in myeloid cell functions that promote atherosclerosis via inflammation, including a potential role for IL-6. Next, we describe vascular intrinsic factors by which ageing promotes atherogenesis - in particular, the effects on mitochondrial function. Studies in mice and humans have shown that ageing leads to a decline in vascular mitochondrial function and impaired mitophagy. In mice, ageing is associated with an elevation in the levels of the inflammatory cytokine IL-6 in the aorta, which participates in a positive feedback loop with the impaired vascular mitochondrial function to accelerate atherogenesis. We speculate that vascular and myeloid cell ageing synergize, via IL-6 signalling, to accelerate atherosclerosis. Finally, we propose future avenues of clinical investigation and potential therapeutic approaches to reduce the burden of atherosclerosis in old people.","D.J.T. is supported by NIH award F32-HL1400728, and D.R.G. is supported by NIH awards R01-HL127687, R01-AI138347 and K07-AG050096.",Nature Reviews Cardiology,,,2020-09-11,2020,,,1-11,All OA; Gold,Article,"Tyrrell, Daniel J.; Goldstein, Daniel R.","Tyrrell, Daniel J.

METHODS: An online cross-sectional study was conducted. A questionnaire assessed perceived risk and collected independent variables, including sociodemographic data. A multivariable linear regression model was employed to characterize the relationship between independent variables and perceived risk. RESULTS: We included 1,379 respondents in the final analysis with the mean and median of perceived risk was 19.21% and 10.0%, respectively. Respondents aged between 21-30 years had the highest perceived risk, and those who were unmarried had 4.3% higher perceived risk compared to those who were married. Compared to the lowest monthly income group, those making Indonesian Rupiah (IDR) 6-10 million and more than IDR 10 million a month believed they had 4.2% and 8.8% higher risk, respectively. Citizens who lived in cities and healthcare workers also had a higher perceived risk compared to those in the rural areas and non-healthcare workers, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Perceived risk of COVID-19 in Indonesia is relatively low and this could hamper the adoption of preventive measures of COVID-19.

IPV is associated with an increased risk of homicide, with firearms as the most commonly used weapon.  We designed this study to better understand the correlation of interpersonal trauma exposures and demographic factors on firearm perceptions among a cohort of IPV-exposed women. Methods: 267 women in central Pennsylvania with exposure to IPV were surveyed about perceptions of gun access, safety, and gun presence in the home. Trauma variables included IPV type, IPV recency, unwanted sexual exposure, and adverse childhood experiences (ACEs). Multivariable analyses examined three questions examining firearm perceptions controlling for trauma exposures and demographics.Results: Ease of firearm acquisition: Women who were older (mean 44.92 years +/- SD 12.05) , compared to women who were younger (40.91 +/- SD 11.81 years) were more likely to describe it as easy or very easy to acquire a gun (aOR 1.05, 95%CI 1.004, 1.10).Perceived safety in the proximity of a gun: Women with the highest ACE score were less likely to feel safe with a gun nearby (aOR 0.31, 95%CI 0.14,0.67).  Odds of guns in the home: Women who were divorced or separated (aOR 0.22, 95%CI 0.09,0.54), women were widowed or single (aOR0.23, 95%CI 0.08,0.67), and women who were partnered (aOR 0.45 95%CI 0.20, 0.97) had lower odds of having a gun in the home, compared to married women. There was no significant effect of the trauma variables on the odds of having a gun at home.Conclusions: Women with more severe childhood trauma felt less safe around firearms, but trauma exposures did not predict the perception of gun prevalence in the local community or gun ownership. Instead, demographic factors of marriage predicted presence of a gun in the home.",,Research Square,,,2020-09-10,2020,,,,"All OA; Green, Published",Preprint,"Leuenberger, Laura; McCall-Hosenfeld, Jennifer; Lehman, Erik","Leuenberger, Laura (University of Michigan); McCall-Hosenfeld, Jennifer (Penn State College of Medicine); Lehman, Erik (Pennsylvania State University)",,"Leuenberger, Laura (University of Michigan); McCall-Hosenfeld, Jennifer (); Lehman, Erik (Pennsylvania State University)",University of Michigan; Pennsylvania State University,grid.214458.e; grid.29857.31,United States; United States,,0,0,,,,https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-31669/v2.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1130758801,1117 Public Health and Health Services; 11 Medical and Health Sciences,"16 Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions"

DESIGN: Using detailed financial reporting from fiscal year (FY) 2018 from Ohio's local health departments (LHDs), we characterize spending by Foundational Public Health Services (FPHS). We also constructed estimates of the gap in public health spending in the state using self-reported gaps in service provision and a microsimulation approach. Data were collected between January and June 2019 and analyzed between June and September 2019. PARTICIPANTS: Eighty-four of the 113 LHDs in the state of Ohio covering a population of almost 9 million Ohioans. RESULTS: In FY2018, Ohio LHDs spent an average of $37 per capita on protecting and promoting the public's health. Approximately one-third of this investment supported the Foundational Areas (communicable disease control; chronic disease and injury prevention; environmental public health; maternal, child, and family health; and access to and linkages with health care). Another third supported the Foundational Capabilities, that is, the crosscutting skills and capacities needed to support all LHD activities. The remaining third supported programs and activities that are responsive to local needs and vary from community to community. To fully meet identified LHD needs in the state pre-COVID-19, Ohio would require an additional annual investment of $20 per capita on top of the current $37 spent per capita, or approximately $240 million for the state.

Up to now, the process of creating the human footprint index has required significant data and modeling, and updated versions of the index often lag the present day by many years. Here we introduce a near-present, global-scale machine learning-based human footprint index (ml-HFI) which is capable of routine update using satellite imagery alone. We present the most up-to-date map of the human footprint index, and document changes in human pressure during the past 20 years (2000 to 2019). Moreover, we demonstrate its utility as a monitoring tool for the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 15 (SDG15), “Life on Land”, which aims to foster sustainable development while conserving biodiversity. We identify countries that are making progress toward SDG15 while also experiencing increases in their ml-HFI. We briefly examine a subset of these in the context of conservation policies that may or may not enable continued progress toward SDG15. This has immediate policy relevance, since the majority of countries globally are not on track to achieve Goal 15 by the declared deadline of 2030. Moving forward, the ml-HFI may be used for ongoing monitoring and evaluation support toward the twin goals of fostering a thriving society and global Earth system.","This research was funded, in part, by the United States National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) under grant #18-SLSCVC18-0006.",bioRxiv,,,2020-09-09,2020,,,2020.09.06.284414,"All OA; Green, Published",Preprint,"Keys, Patrick W.; Barnes, Elizabeth A.; Carter, Neil H.","Keys, Patrick W.

Social isolation, or the absence of social relationships, is associated with a wide range of negative health outcomes; however, most studies of social isolation have been conducted among predominantly White samples. As a consequence, we know very little about social isolation among Black men. Using an intersectionality framework, this study examines the prevalence and correlates of social isolation among men who identify as African Americanor Black Caribbean.Data come from the National Survey of American Life (NSAL), a nationally representative sample ofAfrican Americans, Black Caribbeans, and Whites living in the United States. The current study focuses on men who identified as African American or Black Caribbean. Further, within this sample, we distinguish by ethnicity and nativity in examining Black men who are African American (native to the U.S.), U.S.-born Black Caribbean men, and foreign-born Black Caribbean men. Social isolation was operationalized using two constructs: interpersonal isolation and structural isolation. The analyses adjusted for age, education, income, marital status, and region. We conducted a series of Poisson regressions to determine: (1) ethnic differences in interpersonal and structural social isolation and (2) ethnic-specific correlates of interpersonal and structural social isolation among Black men. All analyses accounted for the complex study design of the NSAL.There were no significant ethnic differences among Black men for interpersonal isolation. However, U.S. born Black Caribbean men had higher rates of structural social isolation compared to African American men and foreign-born Black Caribbean men. There were very few differences in the correlates of interpersonal isolation among Black men regardless of ethnicity. However, in terms of structural isolation, African American men had more significant correlates in comparison to U.S. born Black Caribbean men and foreign-born Black Caribbean men.",,International Journal of Mens Social and Community Health,,,2020-09-08,2020,3,2,e1-e18,All OA; Gold,Article,"Taylor, Harry Owen; Taylor, Robert Joseph","Taylor, Harry Owen (The Center for the Study of Aging and Human Development, Duke University); Taylor, Robert Joseph (University of Michigan)",,"Taylor, Harry Owen (Duke University); Taylor, Robert Joseph (University of Michigan)",Duke University; University of Michigan,grid.26009.3d; grid.214458.e,United States; United States,,0,0,,,,https://ijmsch.com/index.php/IJMSCH/article/download/33/24,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1130692338,1608 Sociology; 16 Studies in Human Society,

Here, the association of older adults' expectations concerning the pandemic's duration and impact with perceived stress (PS) and negative affect (NA) are investigated. Based on the stress and coping framework, PS is expected to mediate the association between COVID-19 expectations and NA. METHOD: 714 residents of the US and aged 60 and older completed an anonymous online survey in late March 2020 reporting PS, NA, and expectations regarding the pandemic. RESULTS: Regression analyses controlling for demographic factors revealed that more dire pandemic expectations significantly predicted PS and NA directly, and the effects on NA were significantly mediated by PS. DISCUSSION: Findings provide evidence that expectations about a pandemic influence the extent to which older adults experience stress and NA in the midst of a pandemic event.

There is little existing data on the mutations in SARS-CoV-2 and the impact of these polymorphisms on its transmission and viral load. In this study, the SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequence was analyzed to identify variants within the 3’UTR region of its cis-regulatory RNA elements. A 43-nucleotide genetic element with a highly conserved stem-loop II-like motif (S2M), was discovered. The research revealed 32 G>U and 16 G>U/A mutations located within the S2M sequence in human SARS-CoV-2 models. These polymorphisms appear to make the S2M secondary and tertiary structures in human SARS-CoV-2 models less stable when compared to the S2M structures of bat/pangolin models. This grants the RNA structures more flexibility, which could be one of its escape mechanisms from host defenses or facilitate its entry into host proteins and enzymes. While this S2M sequence may not be omnipresent across all human SARS-CoV-2 models, when present, its sequence is always highly conserved. It may be used as a potential target for the development of vaccines and therapeutic agents.",Authors would like to that Nextstrain for providing a real-time snapshot of evolving SARS-CoV2.,bioRxiv,,,2020-09-03,2020,,,2020.09.02.280529,"All OA; Green, Published",Preprint,"Vahed, Majid; Vahed, Mohammad; Sweeney, Aaron; Shirazi, Farshad H; Mirsaeidi, Mehdi","Vahed, Majid (Pharmaceutical Sciences Research Center, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Niayesh Highway, Valiasr Ave, Tehran, Iran; Department of Toxicology/Pharmacology, School of Pharmacy, Shahid Beheshti, University of Medical Sciences, Niayesh Highway, Valiasr Ave, Tehran, Iran); Vahed, Mohammad (Department of Computational Medicine and Bioinformatics, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, 48105, USA); Sweeney, Aaron (Department of Medicine, School of Medicine, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada); Shirazi, Farshad H (Pharmaceutical Sciences Research Center, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Niayesh Highway, Valiasr Ave, Tehran, Iran; Department of Toxicology/Pharmacology, School of Pharmacy, Shahid Beheshti, University of Medical Sciences, Niayesh Highway, Valiasr Ave, Tehran, Iran); Mirsaeidi, Mehdi (Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care, Sleep and Allergy, Department of Medicine, Miller School of Medicine, University of Miami, Miami, FL, United States)","Mirsaeidi, Mehdi (University of Miami)","Vahed, Majid (Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences; Tehran University of Medical Sciences); Vahed, Mohammad (University of Michigan); Sweeney, Aaron (McGill University); Shirazi, Farshad H (Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences; Tehran University of Medical Sciences); Mirsaeidi, Mehdi (University of Miami)",Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences; University of Michigan; University of Miami; McGill University; Tehran University of Medical Sciences,grid.411600.2; grid.214458.e; grid.26790.3a; grid.14709.3b; grid.411705.6,Iran; United States; United States; Canada; Iran,,0,0,,,42,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2020/09/08/2020.09.02.280529.full.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1130622472,1108 Medical Microbiology; 11 Medical and Health Sciences; 0604 Genetics; 06 Biological Sciences,

Given the challenges in implementing widespread SARS-CoV-2 testing, there is increasing interest in alternative surveillance strategies. METHODS: We tested nasopharyngeal swabs from 1094 decedents in the Wayne County Medical Examiner's office for SARS-CoV-2. All decedents were assessed by a COVID-19 checklist, and decedents flagged by the checklist (298) were preferentially tested. A random sample of decedents not flagged by the checklist were also tested (796). We statistically analyzed the characteristics of decedents (age, sex, race, and manner of death), differentiating between those flagged by the checklist and not and between those SARS-CoV-2 positive and not. RESULTS: A larger percentage of decedents overall were male (70% vs 48%) and Black (55% vs 36%) compared to the catchment population. Seven-day average percent positivity among flagged decedents closely matched the trajectory of percent positivity in the catchment population, particularly during the peak of the outbreak (March and April). After a lull in May to mid-June, new positive tests in late June coincided with increased case detection in the catchment. We found large racial disparities in test results: despite no statistical difference in the racial distribution between those flagged and not, SARS-CoV-2 positive decedents were substantially more likely to be Black (82% vs 51%). SARS-CoV-2 positive decedents were also more likely to be older and to have died of natural causes, including of COVID-19 disease.

The Love and Sex in the Time of COVID-19 survey was conducted online from April to May, 2020. GBMSM were recruited through advertisements featured on social networking platforms, recruiting a sample size of 518 GBMSM. Analysis considers changes three in self-reported measures of sexual behavior: number of sex partners, number of anal sex partners and number of anal sex partners not protected by pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) or condoms. Approximately two-thirds of the sample reported that they believed it was possible to contract COVID-19 through sex, with anal sex reported as the least risky sex act. Men did not generally feel it was important to reduce their number of sex partners during COVID-19, but reported a moderate willingness to have sex during COVID-19. For the period between February and April-May 20,202, participants reported a mean increase of 2.3 sex partners during COVID-19, a mean increase of 2.1 anal sex partners (range - 40 to 70), but a very small increase in the number of unprotected anal sex partners. Increases in sexual behavior during COVID-19 were associated with increases in substance use during the same period. High levels of sexual activity continue to be reported during the COVID-19 lockdown period and these high levels of sexual activity are often paralleled by increases in substance use and binge drinking. There is a clear need to continue to provide comprehensive HIV prevention and care services during COVID-19, and telehealth and other eHealth platforms provide a safe, flexible mechanism for providing services.",,AIDS and Behavior,,,2020-09-02,2020,,,1-9,All OA; Gold,Article,"Stephenson, Rob; Chavanduka, Tanaka M.

Key questions for this ongoing evolution emerge for the global context leading to reflections on future directions for the interprofessional education field and its role in shaping future practice models. Health professions programs around the world have made a dramatic shift to virtual learning platforms in response to closures of academic institutions and restrictions imposed on learners accessing practice settings. Telemedicine, slow to become established in many countries to date, has also revolutionized practice in the current environment. Within the state of disruption and rapid change is the awareness of a silver lining that provides an opportunity for future growth. Key topics explored in this commentary include reflection on the application of existing competency frameworks, consideration of typology of team structures, reconsideration of theoretical underpinnings, revisiting of core dimensions of education, adaptation of interprofessional education activities, and the role in the future pandemic planning. As an international community of educators and researchers, the authors consider current observations relevant to interprofessional education and practice contexts and suggest a response from scholarship voices across the globe. The current pandemic offers a unique opportunity for educators, practitioners, and researchers to retain what has served interprofessional education and practice well in the past, break from what has not worked as well, and begin to imagine the new.",The authors report no conflicts of interest.

We focus on some topics of particular interest to the information science community: data infrastructures for scholarly communication and research, the politicization of data curation and visualization for public‐facing “dashboards,” and human subjects research and policies. We conclude with some areas of opportunity and need, including broader and richer data curation education in the information schools, the establishment of better data management policy implementations by research funders, the award of formal academic credit for data curation activities and data sharing, and engagement in cooperative action around data ethics and security.",,Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology,,,2020-09-02,2020,,,,All OA; Gold,Article,"Shankar, Kalpana; Jeng, Wei; Thomer, Andrea; Weber, Nicholas; Yoon, Ayoung","Shankar, Kalpana (School of Information and Communication Studies, University College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland); Jeng, Wei (Department of Library and Information Science, National University of Taiwan, Taipei, Taiwan); Thomer, Andrea (School of Information, University of Michigan – Ann Arbor, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA); Weber, Nicholas (School of Information, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, USA); Yoon, Ayoung (School of Informatics and Computing, Indiana University–Purdue University Indianapolis, Indianapolis, Indiana, USA)",,"Shankar, Kalpana (University College Dublin); Jeng, Wei (National Taiwan University); Thomer, Andrea (University of Michigan); Weber, Nicholas (University of Washington); Yoon, Ayoung (Indiana University – Purdue University Indianapolis)",University College Dublin; Indiana University – Purdue University Indianapolis; National Taiwan University; University of Michigan; University of Washington,grid.7886.1; grid.257413.6; grid.19188.39; grid.214458.e; grid.34477.33,Ireland; United States; Taiwan; United States; United States,,0,0,,,5,https://asistdl.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1002/asi.24406,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1130540593,1608 Sociology; 16 Studies in Human Society,

The autophagy machinery adopted the structural architecture of ubiquitin and employs two ubiquitin-like protein conjugation systems for autophagosome biogenesis. Ubiquitin chains that are attached as labels to protein aggregates or subcellular organelles confer selectivity, allowing autophagy receptors to simultaneously bind ubiquitinated cargos and autophagy-specific ubiquitin-like modifiers (Atg8-family proteins). Moreover, there is tremendous crosstalk between autophagy and the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Ubiquitination of autophagy-related proteins or regulatory components plays significant roles in the precise control of the autophagy pathway. In this review, we summarize and discuss the molecular mechanisms and functions of ubiquitin and ubiquitination, in the process and regulation of autophagy.",,Cells,,,2020-09-02,2020,9,9,2025,All OA; Gold,Article,"Yin, Zhangyuan; Popelka, Hana; Lei, Yuchen; Yang, Ying; Klionsky, Daniel J.","Yin, Zhangyuan (Life Sciences Institute, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, USA;, zyyin@umich.edu, (Z.Y.);, popelka@umich.edu, (H.P.);, yclei@umich.edu, (Y.L.);, yingyan@umich.edu, (Y.Y.); Department of Molecular, Cellular and Developmental Biology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, USA); Popelka, Hana (Life Sciences Institute, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, USA;, zyyin@umich.edu, (Z.Y.);, popelka@umich.edu, (H.P.);, yclei@umich.edu, (Y.L.);, yingyan@umich.edu, (Y.Y.)); Lei, Yuchen (Life Sciences Institute, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, USA;, zyyin@umich.edu, (Z.Y.);, popelka@umich.edu, (H.P.);, yclei@umich.edu, (Y.L.);, yingyan@umich.edu, (Y.Y.); Department of Molecular, Cellular and Developmental Biology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, USA); Yang, Ying (Life Sciences Institute, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, USA;, zyyin@umich.edu, (Z.Y.);, popelka@umich.edu, (H.P.);, yclei@umich.edu, (Y.L.);, yingyan@umich.edu, (Y.Y.); Department of Molecular, Cellular and Developmental Biology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, USA); Klionsky, Daniel J.

They also need to prioritize appointment rescheduling during the ramp-up phase (when pandemic-associated service reductions are eased). Objective: To describe a flexible and scalable scoring algorithm for patients with glaucoma that considers glaucoma severity and progression risk vs the presence of high-risk features for morbidity from COVID-19, using information from a large data repository. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this cross-sectional study, patients with upcoming clinic appointments for glaucoma from March 16, 2020, to April 16, 2020, at an academic institution enrolled in the Sight Outcomes Research Collaborative (SOURCE) Ophthalmology Electronic Health Record Data Repository were identified. A risk stratification tool was developed that calculated a glaucoma severity and progression risk score and a COVID-19 morbidity risk score. These scores were summed to determine a total score for each patient. Main Outcomes and Measures: Total scores and percentages of clinic appointments recommended for rescheduling. Results: Among the 1034 patients with upcoming clinic appointments for glaucoma, the mean (SD) age was 66.7 (14.6) years. There were 575 women (55.6%), 733 White individuals (71%), and 160 Black individuals (15.5%). The mean (SD) glaucoma severity and progression risk score was 4.0 (14.4) points, the mean (SD) COVID-19 morbidity risk score was 27.2 (16.1) points, and the mean (SD) total score was 31.2 (21.4) points. During pandemic-associated reductions in services, using total score thresholds of 0, 25, and 50 points would identify 970 appointments (93.8%), 668 appointments (64.6%), and 275 appointments (26.6%), respectively, for postponement and rescheduling. The algorithm-generated total scores also helped prioritize appointment rescheduling during the ramp-up phase. Conclusions and Relevance: A tool that considers the risk of underlying ophthalmic disease progression from delayed care receipt and the morbidity risk from COVID-19 exposure was developed and implemented, facilitating the triage of upcoming ophthalmic appointments. Comparable approaches for other ophthalmic and nonophthalmic care during the COVID-19 pandemic and similar crises may be created using this methodology.",,JAMA Ophthalmology,,"Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Ambulatory Care Facilities; Appointments and Schedules; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Glaucoma; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Ophthalmology; Outcome Assessment, Health Care; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Triage",2020-09-01,2020,138,9,974-980,All OA; Gold,Article,"Bommakanti, Nikhil K.; Zhou, Yunshu; Ehrlich, Joshua R.; Elam, Angela R.; John, Denise; Kamat, Shivani S.; Kelstrom, Jared; Newman-Casey, Paula Anne; Shah, Manjool M.; Weizer, Jennifer S.; Wood, Sarah D.; Zhang, Amy D.; Zhang, Jason; Lee, Paul P.; Stein, Joshua D.","Bommakanti, Nikhil K.

Many oncologists are having challenging conversations with their patients about how the COVID-19 pandemic is affecting cancer care and may desire evidence-based communication guidance. Objectives: To identify the clinical scenarios that pose communication challenges, understand patient reactions to these scenarios, and develop a communication guide with sample responses. Design, Setting, and Participants: This qualitative study that was conducted at a single Midwestern academic medical center invited physicians to respond to a brief semistructured interview by email or telephone and then disseminated an anonymous online survey among patients with cancer. Oncology-specific, COVID-19-related clinical scenarios were identified by the physicians, and potential reactions to these scenarios were gleaned from the patient responses to the survey. Health communication experts were invited to participate in the iterative development of a communication guide, comprising 3 essential communication principles and strategies and informed by insights from physicians and patients. This study was conducted from March 25, 2020, to April 2, 2020. Interventions: Expert review, interviews, and surveys assessing challenging situations specific to cancer management during the COVID-19 pandemic. Main Outcomes and Measures: Oncology-specific, COVID-19-related clinical scenarios from physician interviews; responses to each scenario from patient surveys; and applicable communication principles from health communication expert literature review. Results: Of the 8 physicians who participated in interviews, 4 were men (50%) and 4 were women (50%). These physicians represented the following disciplines: internal medicine (n = 1), hematology/oncology (n = 2), radiation oncology (n = 3), and surgical oncology (n = 2). Their disease site specialization included cancers of the breast, head and neck, melanoma, and gastrointestinal and genitourinary tracts. A total of 48 patients with cancer completed the online survey; no demographic information was collected from the patients. The physicians identified 8 oncology-specific, COVID-19-related scenarios in which communication might be challenging: (1) worse outcomes from COVID-19, (2) delay in cancer screening, (3) delay in diagnostic workup, (4) delay in initiation of treatment, (5) offer of nonstandard treatment, (6) treatment breaks, (7) delay in follow-up imaging or care, and (8) inability to be admitted into the hospital for management. Potential patient reactions to each of these scenarios were compiled from survey responses. For most scenarios, patient reactions involved anger, fear, and anxiety (eg, ""I'm scared""; ""This isn't fair. I am upset.""). These emotional patient responses informed the selection of the 3 general communication principles, which suggested language and strategies that physicians can use to respond to patients. Conclusions and Relevance: In this qualitative study, physicians and patients identified communication needs used by health communication experts to inform the development of a practical, evidence-based communication guide for oncology care during the COVID-19 pandemic.",,JAMA Oncology,,"Betacoronavirus; Communication; Coronavirus Infections; Delivery of Health Care; Female; Humans; Language; Male; Neoplasms; Oncologists; Pandemics; Patients; Physicians; Pneumonia, Viral; Telemedicine",2020-09-01,2020,6,9,1424-1428,All OA; Gold,Article,"Gharzai, Laila A.; Resnicow, Kenneth; An, Lawrence C.; Jagsi, Reshma","Gharzai, Laila A.

In the context of pandemic SARS-CoV-2 infection, patients with cancer have been identified as a group at high risk of morbidity and mortality from this infection. Our subcommittee of the NCCN Hematopoietic Growth Factors Panel convened a voluntary group to review the potential value of expanded use of such growth factors in the current high-risk environment. Although recommendations are available on the NCCN website in the COVID-19 Resources Section (https://www.nccn.org/covid-19/), these suggestions are provided without substantial context or reference.

Yet, access to the levels of water supply that support good hand hygiene and institutional cleaning, our understanding of hygiene behaviours, and access to soap are deficient in low-, middle- and high-income countries. This paper reviews the role of water, sanitation and hygiene (WaSH) in disease emergence, previous outbreaks, combatting COVID-19 and in preparing for future pandemics. We consider settings where these factors are particularly important and identify key preventive contributions to disease control and gaps in the evidence base. Urgent substantial action is required to remedy deficiencies in WaSH, particularly the provision of reliable, continuous piped water on-premises for all households and settings. Hygiene promotion programmes, underpinned by behavioural science, must be adapted to high-risk populations (such as the elderly and marginalised) and settings (such as healthcare facilities, transport hubs and workplaces). WaSH must be better integrated into preparation plans and with other sectors in prevention efforts. More finance and better use of financing instruments would extend and improve WaSH services. The lessons outlined justify no-regrets investment by government in response to and recovery from the current pandemic; to improve day-to-day lives and as preparedness for future pandemics.",,Journal of Water Sanitation and Hygiene for Development,,,2020-09-01,2020,10,3,379-396,All OA; Gold,Article,"Howard, Guy; Bartram, Jamie; Brocklehurst, Clarissa; Colford, John M.; Costa, Federico; Cunliffe, David; Dreibelbis, Robert; Eisenberg, Joseph Neil Spindel; Evans, Barbara; Girones, Rosina; Hrudey, Steve; Willetts, Juliet; Wright, Caradee Y.","Howard, Guy (Department of Civil Engineering, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK); Bartram, Jamie (School of Civil Engineering, University of Leeds, Leeds, UK; Gilling School of Global Public Health, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, USA); Brocklehurst, Clarissa (Gilling School of Global Public Health, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, USA); Colford, John M.

While globally the pandemic is at different stages and far from under control in some countries, now is the time for public health researchers and political scientists to start understanding how and why governments responded the way they have, explore how effective these responses appear to be, and what lessons we can draw about effective public health policymaking in preparation of the next wave of COVID-19 or the next infectious disease pandemic. We argue that there will be no way to understand the different responses to COVID-19 and their effects without understanding policy and politics. We propose four key focuses to understand the reasons for COVID-19 responses: social policies to crisis management as well as recovery, regime type (democracy or autocracy), formal political institutions (federalism, presidentialism), and state capacity (control over health care systems and public administration). A research agenda to address the COVID-19 pandemic that takes politics as a serious focus can enable the development of more realistic, sustainable interventions in policies and shape our broader understanding of the politics of public health.",SLG has consulted for the U.S. Army Engineer Research and Development Center and the European Observatory on Health Systems and Policies.

To date, there are no studies that compared the disease severity of COVID-19 in SOT recipients with nontransplant patients. METHODS: In this case-control study, we compared the outcomes of COVID-19 between SOT recipients and their matched nontransplant controls. The cases were all adult SOT recipients (N=41) from our academic health center who were diagnosed with COVID-19 between 3/10/20 and 5/15/20 using positive reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction for SARS-CoV2. The controls(N=121) were matched on age(±5years), race, and admission status (hospital or outpatient). The primary outcome was death and secondary outcomes were severe disease, intubation and renal replacement therapy(RRT). RESULTS: Median age of SOT recipients(9-heart, 3-lung, 16-kidney, 8-liver, 5-dual-organ) was 60 years, 80% were male and 67% were Black. Severe disease adjusted risk of death was similar in both the groups(HR=0.84[0.32-2.20]). Severity of COVID-19 and intubation were similar but the RRT use was higher in SOT (OR=5.32[1.26, 22.42]) compared to non-SOT COVID-19 patients. Among SOT recipients, COVID-19-related treatment with hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) was associated with ten-fold higher hazard of death compared to without HCQ (HR=10.62[1.24-91.09]). CONCLUSIONS: Although African-Americans constituted one-tenth of all SOT in our center, they represented two-thirds of COVID-19 cases. Despite high RRT use in SOT recipients, the severe disease and short-term death were similar in both groups. HCQ for the treatment of COVID-19 among SOT recipients was associated with high mortality and therefore, its role as a treatment modality requires further scrutiny.",,Transplantation,,,2020-09-01,2020,Publish Ahead of Print,,,All OA; Gold,Article,"Sharma, Pratima; Chen, Vincent; Fung, Christopher M; Troost, Jonathan P; Patel, Vaiibhav N; Combs, Michael; Norman, Silas; Garg, Puneet; Colvin, Monica; Aaronson, Keith; Sonnenday, Christopher J; Golob, Jonathan L; Somers, Emily C; Doshi, Mona M","Sharma, Pratima (Department of Internal Medicine, Michigan Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109.); Chen, Vincent (Department of Internal Medicine, Michigan Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109.); Fung, Christopher M (Department of Emergency Medicine, Michigan Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109.); Troost, Jonathan P (Michigan Institute for Clinical and Health Research, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109.); Patel, Vaiibhav N (Department of Internal Medicine, Michigan Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109.); Combs, Michael (Department of Internal Medicine, Michigan Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109.); Norman, Silas (Department of Internal Medicine, Michigan Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109.); Garg, Puneet (Department of Internal Medicine, Michigan Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109.); Colvin, Monica (Department of Internal Medicine, Michigan Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109.); Aaronson, Keith (Department of Internal Medicine, Michigan Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109.); Sonnenday, Christopher J (Department of Surgery, School of Public Health Michigan Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109.); Golob, Jonathan L (Department of Internal Medicine, Michigan Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109.); Somers, Emily C (Department of Internal Medicine, Michigan Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109.; Environmental Health Sciences, School of Public Health Michigan Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109.); Doshi, Mona M (Department of Internal Medicine, Michigan Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109.)",,"Sharma, Pratima (); Chen, Vincent (); Fung, Christopher M (); Troost, Jonathan P (University of Michigan); Patel, Vaiibhav N (); Combs, Michael (); Norman, Silas (); Garg, Puneet (); Colvin, Monica (); Aaronson, Keith (); Sonnenday, Christopher J (University of Michigan); Golob, Jonathan L (); Somers, Emily C (University of Michigan); Doshi, Mona M ()",University of Michigan,grid.214458.e,United States,,1,1,,,61,https://journals.lww.com/transplantjournal/Abstract/9000/COVID_19_Outcomes_Among_Solid_Organ_Transplant.95550.aspx,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1130622455,11 Medical and Health Sciences; 1103 Clinical Sciences,

The aim is to bring LTC migrant carers into health workforce research and highlight a need for trans-sectoral and European heath workforce governance. We apply an exploratory approach based on secondary sources, document analysis and expert information. A framework comprising four major dimensions was developed for data collection and analysis: LTC system, LTC health labour market, LTC labour migration policies and specific LTC migrant carer policies during the COVID-19 crisis March to May 2020. Material from Austria, Italy, Germany, Poland and Romania was included in the study. Results suggest that undersupply of carers coupled with cash benefits and a culture of family responsibility may result in high inflows of migrant carers, who are channelled in low-level positions or the informal care sector. COVID-19 made the fragile labour market arrangements of migrant carers visible, which may create new health risks for both the individual carer and the population. Two important policy recommendations are emerging: to include LTC migrant carers more systematically in public health and health workforce research and to develop European health workforce governance which connects health system needs, health labour markets and the individual migrant carers.","Natasha Azzopardi-Muscat, Marleen Bekker, Viola Burau, Scott Greer and Holly Jarman contributed to discussions in an earlier stage of work, which was presented at a workshop ‘Care4Care: the migrant care workforce in Europe’ at the EPH Conference in Marseille 2019.

Yet, blacks report higher cumulative stress exposure than whites but lower levels of common psychiatric disorders. In order to understand why blacks bear disproportionate stress exposure but similar or better mental health relative to whites, we need to consider race differences in not only stress exposure, but also stress appraisal-how upsetting stress exposures are perceived to be. Research Design and Methods: We examine whether race differences in the number of reported chronic stressors across 5 domains (health, financial, residential, relationship, and caregiving) and their appraised stressfulness explain black-white differences in anxiety and depressive symptoms. Data come from 6019 adults aged older than 52 from the 2006 Health and Retirement Study. Results: Older blacks in this sample experience greater exposure to chronic stressors but appraise stressors as less upsetting relative to whites. In fully adjusted models, stress exposure is related to higher levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms, and perceiving stress as upsetting is associated with higher symptomology for whites and blacks. We also find that blacks report greater anxiety symptoms but fewer depressive symptoms with more stress exposure relative to whites. Stress appraisal partially explains race differences in the association between stress exposure and anxiety symptoms and fully explains race differences in the association between exposure and depressive symptoms. Discussion and Implications: The relationship between race, chronic stress exposure, and mental health is mediated by stress appraisal. Stress appraisal provides insight on important pathways contributing to black-white mental health disparities in older adulthood.",,Innovation in Aging,,,2020-09-01,2020,4,5,igaa040-,All OA; Gold,Article,"Brown, Lauren L; Abrams, Leah R; Mitchell, Uchechi A; Ailshire, Jennifer A","Brown, Lauren L (Population Studies Center, Institute for Social Research, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan); Abrams, Leah R (Department of Health Management and Policy, University of Michigan School of Public Health, Ann Arbor, Michigan); Mitchell, Uchechi A (Division of Community Health Sciences, School of Public Health, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, Illinois); Ailshire, Jennifer A (Leonard Davis School of Gerontology, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California)",,"Brown, Lauren L (University of Michigan); Abrams, Leah R (University of Michigan); Mitchell, Uchechi A (University of Illinois at Chicago); Ailshire, Jennifer A (University of Southern California)",University of Michigan; University of Southern California; University of Illinois at Chicago,grid.214458.e; grid.42505.36; grid.185648.6,United States; United States; United States,National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities; National Institute on Aging,0,0,,,,https://academic.oup.com/innovateage/advance-article-pdf/doi/10.1093/geroni/igaa040/33723360/igaa040.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1130667012,1117 Public Health and Health Services; 17 Psychology and Cognitive Sciences; 11 Medical and Health Sciences; 1701 Psychology,

The frequency of potentially identifiable disclosures online during periods of active engagement is unknown. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to quantify potentially identifiable content shared on social media by physicians and other health care providers using the hashtag #ShareAStoryInOneTweet. METHODS: We accessed and searched Twitter's API using Symplur software for tweets that included the hashtag #ShareAStoryInOneTweet. We identified 1206 tweets by doctors, nurses, and other health professionals out of 43,374 tweets shared in May 2018. Tweet content was evaluated in January 2019 to determine the incidence of instances where names or potentially identifiable information about patients were shared; content analysis of tweets in which information about others had been disclosed was performed. The study also evaluated whether participants raised concerns about privacy breaches and estimated the frequency of deleted tweets. The study used dual, blinded coding for a 10% sample to estimate intercoder reliability using Cohen κ statistic for identifying the potential identifiability of tweet content. RESULTS: Health care professionals (n=656) disclosing information about others included 486 doctors (74.1%) and 98 nurses (14.9%). Health care professionals sharing stories about patient care disclosed the time frame in 95 tweets (95/754, 12.6%) and included patient names in 15 tweets (15/754, 2.0%). It is estimated that friends or families could likely identify the clinical scenario described in 242 of the 754 tweets (32.1%). Among 348 tweets about potentially living patients, it was estimated that 162 (46.6%) were likely identifiable by patients. Intercoder reliability in rating the potential identifiability demonstrated 86.8% agreement, with a Cohen κ of 0.8 suggesting substantial agreement. We also identified 78 out of 754 tweets (6.5%) that had been deleted on the website but were still viewable in the analytics software data set. CONCLUSIONS: During periods of active sharing online, nurses, physicians, and other health professionals may sometimes share more information than patients or families might expect. More study is needed to determine whether similar events arise frequently and to understand how to best ensure that patients' rights are adequately respected.",,Journal of Medical Internet Research,,,2020-09-01,2020,22,9,e19746,All OA; Gold,Article,"Ahmed, Wasim; Jagsi, Reshma; Gutheil, Thomas G; Katz, Matthew S","Ahmed, Wasim (Department of Marketing, Operations and Systems, Newcastle University Business School, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom.); Jagsi, Reshma (Department of Radiation Oncology, Center for Bioethics and Social Science in Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, United States.); Gutheil, Thomas G (Department of Psychiatry, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Mass.

Objective: To examine how often patients referred to home health care at hospital discharge receive it and whether there is evidence of disparities. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional study used Medicare data regarding the postacute home health care setting from October 1, 2015, through September 30, 2016. The participants were Medicare fee-for-service and Medicare Advantage beneficiaries who were discharged alive from a hospital with a referral to home health care (2 379 506 discharges). Statistical analysis was performed from July 2019 to June 2020. Exposures: Hospital referral to home health care. Main Outcomes and Measures: Primary outcomes included whether discharges received their first home health care visit within 14 days of hospital discharge and the number of days between hospital discharge and the first home health visit. Differences in the likelihood of receiving home health care across patient, zip code, and hospital characteristics were also examined. Results: Among 2 379 506 discharges from the hospital with a home health care referral, 1 358 697 patients (57.1%) were female, 468 762 (19.7%) were non-White, and 466 383 (19.6%) were dually enrolled in Medicare and Medicaid; patients had a mean (SD) age of 73.9 (11.9) years and 4.1 (2.1) Elixhauser comorbidities. Only 1 284 300 patients (54.0%) discharged from the hospital with a home health referral received home health care services within 14 days of discharge. Of the remaining 1 095 206 patients (46.0%) discharged, 37.7% (896 660 discharges) never received any home health care, while 8.3% (198 546 discharges) were institutionalized or died within 14 days without a preceding home health care visit. Patients who were Black or Hispanic received home health at lower rates than did patients who were White (48.0% [95% CI, 47.8%-48.1%] of Black and 46.1% [95% CI, 45.7%-46.5%] of Hispanic discharges received home health within 14 days compared with 55.3% [95% CI, 55.2%-55.4%] of White discharges). In addition, disadvantaged patients waited longer for their first home health care visit. For example, patients living in high-unemployment zip codes waited a mean of 2.0 days (95% CI, 2.0-2.0 days), whereas those living in low-unemployment zip codes waited 1.8 days (95% CI, 1.8-1.8 days). Conclusions and Relevance: Disparities in the use of home health care remain an issue in the US. As home health care is increasingly presented as a safer alternative to institutional postacute care during coronavirus disease 2019, and payment reforms continue to pressure hospitals to discharge patients home, ensuring the availability of safe and equitable care will be crucial to maintaining high-quality care.",,JAMA Network Open,,"African Americans; Aftercare; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Cross-Sectional Studies; European Continental Ancestry Group; Fee-for-Service Plans; Female; Health Services Accessibility; Healthcare Disparities; Hispanic Americans; Home Care Services; Humans; Male; Medicaid; Medicare; Medicare Part C; Patient Discharge; Poverty; Referral and Consultation; Residence Characteristics; Unemployment; United States",2020-09-01,2020,3,9,e2015470,All OA; Gold,Article,"Li, Jun; Qi, Mingyu; Werner, Rachel M.","Li, Jun (Department of Health Management and Policy, School of Public Health, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor; Now with Department of Public Administration and International Affairs, The Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs, Syracuse University, Syracuse, New York); Qi, Mingyu (Department of Medicine, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia); Werner, Rachel M.

Transmission through tissue transplantation is possible and must be considered. This review will evaluate the current literature regarding routes of transmission, the likelihood of transmission through ocular tissue transplantation, and the guidelines in place to mitigate this risk. RECENT FINDINGS: Although respiratory droplets have been the primary route of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, there is evidence that transmission through blood donation and organ or tissue transplantation is possible. This includes corneal transplantation, as SARS-CoV-2 has been detected in conjunctival swabs of infected patients, and the ocular surface may play an important role in viral entry. Several tissue transplantation organizations have guidelines in place regarding the screening of donors and tissue procurement procedures, including clinical and/or PCR screening of donors. The Eye Bank Association of America (EBAA) is currently not recommending asymptomatic PCR screening. However, their antiseptic protocols may play an important role in viral inactivation. SUMMARY: Based on the current literature and guidelines, the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission through corneal transplantation is likely low. However, tissue screening guidelines need to be re-evaluated regularly as knowledge regarding the SARS-CoV-2 virus evolves.",,Current Opinion in Ophthalmology,,"Betacoronavirus; Corneal Transplantation; Coronavirus Infections; Disease Transmission, Infectious; Eye Banks; Humans; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Practice Guidelines as Topic; Tissue Donors; Tissue and Organ Harvesting; Tissue and Organ Procurement",2020-09,2020,31,5,389-395,Closed,Article,"Ballouz, Dena; Mian, Shahzad I","Ballouz, Dena (Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences, W.

The purpose of the present review was to evaluate the potential mechanisms that contribute to this increased risk of coagulopathy and the role of anticoagulants in treatment. METHODS: A literature review of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and/or SARS-CoV-2 and cell-mediated inflammation, clinical coagulation abnormalities, hypercoagulability, pulmonary intravascular coagulopathy, and anticoagulation was performed. The National Clinical Trials database was queried for ongoing studies of anticoagulation and/or antithrombotic treatment or the incidence or prevalence of thrombotic events in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. RESULTS: The reported rate of VTE among critically ill patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 has been 21% to 69%. The phenomenon of breakthrough VTE, or the acute development of VTE despite adequate chemoprophylaxis or treatment dose anticoagulation, has been shown to occur with severe infection. The pathophysiology of overt hypercoagulability and the development of VTE is likely multifactorial, with evidence supporting the role of significant cell-mediated responses, including neutrophils and monocytes/macrophages, endothelialitis, cytokine release syndrome, and dysregulation of fibrinolysis. Collectively, this inflammatory process contributes to the severe pulmonary pathology experienced by patients with COVID-19. As the infection worsens, extreme D-dimer elevations, significant thrombocytopenia, decreasing fibrinogen, and prolongation of prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time occur, often associated with deep vein thrombosis, in situ pulmonary thrombi, and/or pulmonary embolism. A new phenomenon, termed pulmonary intravascular coagulopathy, has been associated with morbidity in patients with severe infection. Heparin, both unfractionated heparin and low-molecular-weight heparin, have emerged as agents that can address the viral infection, inflammation, and thrombosis in this syndrome. CONCLUSIONS: The overwhelming inflammatory response in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection can lead to a hypercoagulable state, microthrombosis, large vessel thrombosis, and, ultimately, death. Early VTE prophylaxis should be provided to all admitted patients. Therapeutic anticoagulation therapy might be beneficial for critically ill patients and is the focus of 39 ongoing trials. Close monitoring for thrombotic complications is imperative, and, if confirmed, early transition from prophylactic to therapeutic anticoagulation should be instituted. The interplay between inflammation and thrombosis has been shown to be a hallmark of the SARS-CoV-2 viral infection.",,Journal of Vascular Surgery Venous and Lymphatic Disorders,,,2020-09,2020,,,,Closed,Article,"Obi, Andrea T; Barnes, Geoffrey D; Napolitano, Lena M; Henke, Peter K; Wakefield, Thomas W","Obi, Andrea T (Section of Vascular Surgery, Department of Surgery, Samuel and Jean Frankel Cardiovascular Center, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Mich.); Barnes, Geoffrey D (Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, Samuel and Jean Frankel Cardiovascular Center, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Mich.); Napolitano, Lena M (Division of Critical Care Surgery, Department of Surgery, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Mich.); Henke, Peter K (Section of Vascular Surgery, Department of Surgery, Samuel and Jean Frankel Cardiovascular Center, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Mich.); Wakefield, Thomas W (Section of Vascular Surgery, Department of Surgery, Samuel and Jean Frankel Cardiovascular Center, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Mich.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a case-control study with cases being those with severe disease, defined as ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, death or discharge to hospice, and controls being those with non-severe disease. Predictor variables included patient demographics, symptoms and past medical history. Participants were 556 patients with laboratory confirmed Covid-19 and were included consecutively after presenting to the emergency department at a tertiary care center from March 1, 2020 to April 21, 2020 RESULTS: Most common symptoms included cough (82%), dyspnea (75%), and fever/chills (77%), with 96% reporting at least one of these. Multivariable logistic regression analysis found that increasing age (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 1.05; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.03-1.06), dyspnea (OR, 2.56; 95% CI: 1.51-4.33), male sex (OR, 1.70; 95% CI: 1.10-2.64), immunocompromised status (OR, 2.22; 95% CI: 1.17-4.16) and CKD (OR, 1.76; 95% CI: 1.01-3.06) were significant predictors of severe Covid-19 infection. Hyperlipidemia was found to be negatively associated with severe disease (OR, 0.54; 95% CI: 0.33-0.90). A predictive equation based on these variables demonstrated fair ability to discriminate severe vs non-severe outcomes using only this historical information (AUC: 0.76). CONCLUSIONS: Severe Covid-19 illness can be predicted using data that could be obtained from a remote screening. With validation, this model could possibly be used for remote triage to prioritize evaluation based on susceptibility to severe disease while avoiding unnecessary waiting room exposure.","The authors acknowledge and thank Chiu-Mei Chen, Caryn Boyd, Dr. Richard Medlin for their roles in assembling the data upon which this work is based.

SETTING: A nested case-control design using confirmed case reports released from the news or the national/provincial/municipal health commissions of China between 18 December 2019 and 8 March 2020. PARTICIPANTS: Patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, excluding asymptomatic patients, in mainland China outside of Hubei Province. OUTCOME MEASURES: Patient demographics, survival time and status, and history of comorbidities. METHOD: A total of 94 publicly reported deaths in locations outside of Hubei Province, mainland China, were included as cases. Each case was matched with up to three controls, based on gender and age ±1 year old (94 cases and 181 controls). The inverse probability-weighted Cox proportional hazard model was performed, controlling for age, gender and the early period of the outbreak. RESULTS: Of the 94 cases, the median age was 72.5 years old (IQR=16), and 59.6% were men, while in the control group the median age was 67 years old (IQR=22), and 64.6% were men. Adjusting for age, gender and the early period of the outbreak, poor health conditions were associated with a higher risk of COVID-19 mortality (HR of comorbidity score, 1.31 [95% CI 1.11 to 1.54]; p=0.001). The estimated mortality risk in patients with pre-existing coronary heart disease (CHD) was three times that of those without CHD (p<0.001). The estimated 30-day survival probability for a profile patient with pre-existing CHD (65-year-old woman with no other comorbidities) was 0.53 (95% CI 0.34 to 0.82), while it was 0.85 (95% CI 0.79 to 0.91) for those without CHD. Older age was also associated with increased mortality risk: every 1-year increase in age was associated with a 4% increased risk of mortality (p<0.001).

We designed and administered a global survey to examine the impact of COVID-19 on vascular surgeons. We describe the impact of the pandemic on the practices of vascular surgeons in the United States. METHODS: The Pandemic Practice, Anxiety, Coping, and Support Survey for Vascular Surgeons is an anonymous cross-sectional survey sponsored by the Society for Vascular Surgery Wellness Task Force disseminated April 14 to 24, 2020. This analysis focuses on pattern changes in vascular surgery practices in the United States including the inpatient setting, ambulatory, and vascular laboratory setting. Specific questions regarding occupational exposure to COVID-19, adequacy of personal protective equipment, elective surgical practice, changes in call schedule, and redeployment to nonvascular surgery duties were also included in the survey. Regional variation was assessed. The survey data were collected using REDCap and analyzed using descriptive statistics. RESULTS: A total of 535 vascular surgeons responded to the survey from 45 states. Most of the respondents were male (73.1%), white (70.7%), practiced in urban settings (81.7%), and in teaching hospitals (66.8%). Almost one-half were in hospitals with more than 400 beds (46.4%). There was no regional variation in the presence of preoperative COVID-19 testing, COVID-19 OR protocols, adherence to national surgical standards, or the availability of personal protective equipment. The overwhelming majority of respondents (91.7%) noted elective surgery cancellation, with the Northeast and Southeast regions having the most case cancellations 94.2% and 95.8%, respectively. The Northeast region reported the highest percentage of operations or procedures on patients with COVID-19, which was either identified at the time of the surgery or later in the hospital course (82.7%). Ambulatory visits were performed via telehealth (81.3%), with 71.1% having restricted hours. More than one-half of office-based laboratories (OBLs) were closed, although there was regional variation with more than 80% in the Midwest being closed. Cases performed in OBLs focused on critical limb ischemia (42.9%) and dialysis access maintenance (39.9%). Call schedules modifications were common, although the number of call days remained the same (45.8%). CONCLUSIONS: Vascular surgeons in the United States report substantial impact on their practices during the COVID-19 pandemic, and regional variations are demonstrated, particularly in OBL use, intensive care bed availability, and COVID-19 exposure at work.",,Journal of Vascular Surgery,,,2020-09,2020,,,,All OA; Gold,Article,"Mouawad, Nicolas J; Woo, Karen; Malgor, Rafael D; Wohlauer, Max V; Johnson, Adam P; Cuff, Robert F; Coleman, Dawn M; Coogan, Sheila M; Sheahan, Malachi G; Shalhub, Sherene","Mouawad, Nicolas J (Division of Vascular & Endovascular Surgery, McLaren Health System, Bay City, Mich; Division of Vascular Surgery, Michigan State University, Lansing, Mich.); Woo, Karen (Division of Vascular Surgery, University of California Los Angeles, Los Angeles, Calif.); Malgor, Rafael D (Division of Vascular Surgery and Endovascular Therapy, The University of Colorado, Anschutz Medical Center, Aurora, Colo.); Wohlauer, Max V (Division of Vascular Surgery and Endovascular Therapy, The University of Colorado, Anschutz Medical Center, Aurora, Colo.); Johnson, Adam P (New York/Presbyterian Weill Cornell School of Medicine, New York, NY.); Cuff, Robert F (Vascular Surgery, Spectrum Health Medical Group, Grand Rapids, Mich.); Coleman, Dawn M (Department of Surgery, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Mich.); Coogan, Sheila M (Department of Cardiovascular Surgery, University of Texas at Houston, Houston, Tex.); Sheahan, Malachi G (Division of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery, Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center, New Orleans, La.); Shalhub, Sherene (Division of Vascular Surgery, Department of Surgery, University of Washington, Seattle, Wash.

Although it has been suggested that elevated levels of blood neutrophils associate with worsening oxygenation in COVID-19, it is unknown whether neutrophils are drivers of the thrombo-inflammatory storm or simple bystanders. To better understand the potential role of neutrophils in COVID-19, we measured levels of the neutrophil activation marker S100A8/A9 (calprotectin) in hospitalized patients and determined its relationship to severity of illness and respiratory status. Patients with COVID-19 (n = 172) had markedly elevated levels of calprotectin in their blood. Calprotectin tracked with other acute phase reactants including C-reactive protein, ferritin, lactate dehydrogenase, and absolute neutrophil count, but was superior in identifying patients requiring mechanical ventilation. In longitudinal samples, calprotectin rose as oxygenation worsened. When tested on day 1 or 2 of hospitalization (n = 94 patients), calprotectin levels were significantly higher in patients who progressed to severe COVID-19 requiring mechanical ventilation (8039 ± 7031 ng/ml, n = 32) as compared to those who remained free of intubation (3365 ± 3146, P","This work was supported by a COVID‐19 Cardiovascular Impact Research Ignitor Grant from the Michigan Medicine Frankel Cardiovascular Center as well as by the A.

Potential future challenges and opportunities,"To assess the impact of COVID-19 on neurovascular research and deal with the challenges imposed by the pandemic. METHODS: A survey-based study focused on randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and single-arm studies for acute ischemic stroke and cerebral aneurysms was developed by a group of senior neurointerventionalists and sent to sites identified through the clinical trials website (https://clinicaltrials.gov/), study sponsors, and physician investigators. RESULTS: The survey was sent to 101 institutions, with 65 responding (64%). Stroke RCTs were being conducted at 40 (62%) sites, aneurysm RCTs at 22 (34%) sites, stroke single-arm studies at 37 (57%) sites, and aneurysm single-arm studies at 43 (66%) sites. Following COVID-19, enrollment was suspended at 51 (78%) sites-completely at 21 (32%) and partially at 30 (46%) sites. Missed trial-related clinics and imaging follow-ups and protocol deviations were reported by 27 (42%), 24 (37%), and 27 (42%) sites, respectively. Negative reimbursements were reported at 17 (26%) sites. The majority of sites, 49 (75%), had put new trials on hold. Of the coordinators, 41 (63%) worked from home and 20 (31%) reported a personal financial impact. Remote consent was possible for some studies at 34 (52%) sites and for all studies at 5 (8%) sites. At sites with suspended trials (n=51), endovascular treatment without enrollment occurred at 31 (61%) sites for stroke and 23 (45%) sites for aneurysms. A total of 277 patients with acute ischemic stroke and 184 with cerebral aneurysms were treated without consideration for trial enrollment. CONCLUSION: Widespread disruption of neuroendovascular trials occurred because of COVID-19. As sites resume clinical research, steps to mitigate similar challenges in the future should be considered.",The authors acknowledge the study coordinators who diligently manage neurovascular clinical trials.

This paper examines the relative perceptions of the severity of COVID-19 and HIV among a sample of U.S. gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (GBMSMs). The ""Love and Sex in the Time of COVID-19"" survey was conducted online from April 2020 to May 2020. GBMSMs were recruited through paid banner advertisements featured on social networking platforms, resulting in a sample size of 696. The analysis considers differences in responses to two scales: the Perceived Severity of HIV Infection and the Perceived Severity of COVID-19 Infection. Participants perceived greater seriousness for HIV infection (mean 46.67, range 17-65) than for COVID-19 infection (mean 38.81, range 13-62). Some items reflecting more proximal impacts of infection (anxiety, loss of sleep, and impact on employment) were similar for HIV and COVID-19. Those aged over 25 and those who perceived higher prevalence of COVID-19 in the United States or their state were more likely to report COVID-19 as more severe than HIV. There is a need to develop nuanced public health messages for GBMSMs that convey the ongoing simultaneous health threats of both HIV and COVID-19.",,American Journal of Men's Health,,"Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Bisexuality; Coronavirus Infections; Cross-Sectional Studies; Ethnic Groups; Female; HIV Infections; Homosexuality, Male; Humans; Incidence; Internet; Male; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Risk Assessment; Risk-Taking; Severity of Illness Index; Sexual Behavior; Survival Analysis; United States; Young Adult",2020-09,2020,14,5,1557988320957545,All OA; Gold,Article,"Stephenson, Rob; Chavanduka, Tanaka M.

No study has yet looked at the impact of coronavirus disease 2019 on the surgical research community. In this study, we sought to understand the impact of the pandemic and its associated restrictions on academic surgeons. METHODS: We surveyed members of the Association for Academic Surgery and the Society of University Surgeons. Survey questions included demographics, current challenges to basic and clinical research activities, attitudes toward remote work and productivity maintenance, and the solutions implemented to maintain productivity. RESULTS: Of 301 respondents, 70% cited a negative impact on research productivity due to mandatory building shutdowns, minimized personnel as a result of social distancing, and suspensions of animal work and clinical trials, with senior faculty and division chiefs and chairs more likely to report a negative impact (P = .001). Only 11% of respondents are documenting their financial losses, and only 19% indicated they received appropriate guidance regarding why and how to monitor the financial impact of the pandemic. Researchers have attempted to maintain research productivity through a focus on remote work, including manuscript writing, grant writing, and data analysis. Some participants have found silver linings, including more time to dedicate to research and family as a result of fewer clinical duties. CONCLUSION: Productivity strategies developed during the pandemic, including writing, remote work and meetings, and structured scheduling, are lessons that will allow the surgical research community to be resilient in the face of future disruptions.","The authors acknowledge the editorial support of Monica Fahrenholtz, with the Office of Surgical Research Administration at Texas Children’s Hospital.

This document provides the rationale and background for the trial and highlights key design features. We discuss five novel challenges to the design and conduct of a large, multicenter, randomized trial during a pandemic, including 1) widespread, off-label use of the study drug before the availability of safety and efficacy data; 2) the need to adapt traditional procedures for documentation of informed consent during an infectious pandemic; 3) developing a flexible and robust Bayesian analysis incorporating significant uncertainty about the disease, outcomes, and treatment; 4) obtaining indistinguishable drug and placebo without delaying enrollment; and 5) rapidly obtaining administrative and regulatory approvals. Our goals in describing how the ORCHID trial progressed from study conception to enrollment of the first patient in 15 days are to inform the development of other high-quality, multicenter trials targeting COVID-19. We describe lessons learned to improve the efficiency of future clinical trials, particularly in the setting of pandemics. The ORCHID trial will provide high-quality, clinically relevant data on the safety and efficacy of hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of COVID-19 among hospitalized adults.Clinical trial registered with www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT04332991).",,Annals of the American Thoracic Society,,"Adult;

Across the world, governments took action to slow the spread and hospitals rushed to accommodate an influx of patients with this highly infectious and lethal disease. The urology departments in Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA, and Herlev and Gentofte, Copenhagen, Denmark — which are linked by the pre-existing CopMich Collaborative — had to respond with massive changes to the organization, staffing and workload of their teams. In this Viewpoint, authors from different urological subspecialties and at different career stages reflect on their experiences during the pandemic. Although their countries’ responses to the COVID-19 pandemic differed radically, the similarities between the responses in Copenhagen and Michigan demonstrate the universal characteristics of medicine and the value of teamwork, flexibility and collaboration. Juan J. Andino is a third-year urology resident at the University of Michigan. He completed his undergraduate and medical degrees, and an MBA at the University of Michigan.

Although video interviewing has become a common part of the hiring process for business, experience with video interviewing for resident and fellow selection has been limited. Advantages of video interviews over traditional on-site interviews include cost-savings to both applicants and residency programs, less disruption to an applicant's educational activities, and potential for training programs to access a wider pool of candidates. The loss of the casual interactions that occur during an on-site interview and the inability of candidates to evaluate training facilities and their surrounding environments in-person are among the obstacles posed by video interviews, but training programs can mitigate these challenges with enhanced website content and creative media solutions. Through a review of the existing literature and internet resources, this article recommends specific measures medical schools, applicants, and radiology residency and fellowship programs can take to optimize the virtual interview experience for all involved parties.",,Academic Radiology,,"Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Internship and Residency; Interviews as Topic; Pandemics; Personnel Selection; Pneumonia, Viral",2020-09,2020,27,9,1316-1322,All OA; Gold,Article,"Joshi, Aparna; Bloom, David A.; Spencer, Amy; Gaetke-Udager, Kara; Cohan, Richard H.","Joshi, Aparna (Department of Radiology, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI); Bloom, David A.

Here we present the lessons learned and recommendations that have emerged from these webinars. METHODS: Fifteen international health care experts from different global regions and oncology disciplines participated in one of the six 1-hour webinars to discuss the latest data, share their experiences, and provide recommendations to manage cancer care during the COVID-19 pandemic. These sessions include didactic presentations followed by a moderated discussion and questions from the audience. All recommendations have been transcribed, categorized, and reviewed by the experts, who have also approved the consensus recommendations. RESULTS: The summary recommendations are divided into different categories, including risk minimization; care prioritization of patients; health care team management; virtual care; management of patients with cancer undergoing surgical, radiation, and systemic therapy; clinical research; and recovery plans. The recommendations emphasize the protection of patients and health care teams from infections, delivery of timely and appropriate care, reduction of harm from the interruption of care, and preparation to handle a surge of new COVID-19 cases, complications, or comorbidities thereof. CONCLUSION: The recommendations from the ASCO Global Webinar Series may guide practicing oncologists to manage their patients during the ongoing pandemic and help organizations recover from the crisis. Implementation of these recommendations may improve understanding of how COVID-19 has affected cancer care and increase readiness to manage the current and any future outbreaks effectively.",,,,"Betacoronavirus; Consensus; Coronavirus Infections; Global Health; Health Services Accessibility; Humans; Infection Control; Medical Oncology; Neoplasms; Oncologists; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Practice Guidelines as Topic; Telemedicine",2020-09,2020,6,6,1461-1471,All OA; Gold,Article,"Jazieh, Abdul Rahman; Chan, Stephen L; Curigliano, Giuseppe; Dickson, Natalie; Eaton, Vanessa; Garcia-Foncillas, Jesus; Gilmore, Terry; Horn, Leora; Kerr, David J; Lee, Jeeyun; Mathias, Clarissa; Nogueira-Rodrigues, Angélica; Pierce, Lori; Rogado, Alvaro; Schilsky, Richard L; Soria, Jean-Charles; Warner, Jeremy L; Yoshida, Kazuhiro","Jazieh, Abdul Rahman (King Saud bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences and King Abdullah International Medical Research Center, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.); Chan, Stephen L (State Key Laboratory of Translational Oncology, Department of Clinical Oncology, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong.); Curigliano, Giuseppe (Istituto Europeo di Oncologia, IRCCS and University of Milano, Milano, Italy.); Dickson, Natalie (Tennessee Oncology, Nashville, TN.); Eaton, Vanessa (ASCO, Alexandria, VA.); Garcia-Foncillas, Jesus (Department of Oncology, Oncohealth Institute, Fundacion Jimenez Diaz University Hospital, Autonomous University, Madrid, Spain.); Gilmore, Terry (ASCO, Alexandria, VA.); Horn, Leora (Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN.); Kerr, David J (University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.); Lee, Jeeyun (Samsung Medical Center, Seoul, Korea.); Mathias, Clarissa (NOB/Grupo Oncoclinicas, Salvador, Brazil.); Nogueira-Rodrigues, Angélica (Brazilian Society of Medical Oncology and Federal University of Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Brazil.); Pierce, Lori (Rogel Cancer Center, Michigan Medicine, Ann Arbor, MI.); Rogado, Alvaro (ECO Foundation for Excellence and Quality in Oncology, Madrid, Spain.); Schilsky, Richard L (ASCO Association for Clinical Oncology, Alexandria, VA.); Soria, Jean-Charles (Gustave Roussy, Paris, France.); Warner, Jeremy L (Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN.); Yoshida, Kazuhiro (Department of Surgical Oncology, Gifu University, Graduate School of Medicine, Gifu, Japan.)",,"Jazieh, Abdul Rahman (King Saud bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences); Chan, Stephen L (Chinese University of Hong Kong); Curigliano, Giuseppe (European Institute of Oncology); Dickson, Natalie (Tennessee Oncology); Eaton, Vanessa (American Society of Clinical Oncology); Garcia-Foncillas, Jesus (Autonomous University of Madrid); Gilmore, Terry (American Society of Clinical Oncology); Horn, Leora (Vanderbilt University); Kerr, David J (University of Oxford); Lee, Jeeyun (Samsung Medical Center); Mathias, Clarissa (); Nogueira-Rodrigues, Angélica (Federal University of Minas Gerais); Pierce, Lori (Michigan Medicine); Rogado, Alvaro (); Schilsky, Richard L (American Society of Clinical Oncology); Soria, Jean-Charles (Institut Gustave Roussy); Warner, Jeremy L (Vanderbilt University); Yoshida, Kazuhiro (Gifu University)",University of Oxford; Chinese University of Hong Kong; European Institute of Oncology; Tennessee Oncology; Gifu University; Vanderbilt University; American Society of Clinical Oncology; Autonomous University of Madrid; Federal University of Minas Gerais; Samsung Medical Center; Institut Gustave Roussy; King Saud bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences; Michigan Medicine,grid.4991.5; grid.10784.3a; grid.15667.33; grid.492963.3; grid.256342.4; grid.152326.1; grid.427738.d; grid.5515.4; grid.8430.f; grid.414964.a; grid.14925.3b; grid.412149.b; grid.412590.b,United Kingdom; China; Italy; United States; Japan; United States; United States; Spain; Brazil; South Korea; France; Saudi Arabia; United States,,0,0,,,32,https://doi.org/10.1200/go.20.00423,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1131339306,1117 Public Health and Health Services; 11 Medical and Health Sciences,

METHODS: We selected a panel of 14 expert endoscopists. We identified 41 common indications for advanced endoscopic procedures from the ASGE Appropriate Use of GI Endoscopy guidelines. Using a modified Delphi method, we first achieved consensus on the patient-important outcome for each procedural indication. Panelists prioritized consensus patient-important outcome when categorizing each indication into one of the following 3 procedural time periods: (1) time-sensitive emergent (schedule within 1 week), (2) time-sensitive urgent (schedule within 1 to 8 weeks), and (3) non-time sensitive (defer for >8 weeks and then reassess the timing). Three anonymous rounds of voting were allowed before attempts at consensus were abandoned. RESULTS: All 14 invited experts agreed to participate in the study. The prespecified consensus threshold of 51% was achieved for assigning patient-important outcome(s) to each advanced endoscopy indication. The prespecified consensus threshold of 66.7% was achieved for 40 of 41 advanced endoscopy indications in stratifying them into 1 of 3 procedural time periods. For 12 of 41 indications, 100% consensus was achieved; for 20 of 41 indications, 75% to 99% consensus was achieved. CONCLUSIONS: By using a Modified Delphi method that prioritized patient-important outcomes, we developed consensus recommendations on procedural timing for common indications for advanced endoscopy. These recommendations and the structured decision framework provided by our study can inform decision making as endoscopy services are reopened.",,Gastrointestinal Endoscopy,,"Attitude of Health Personnel; Betacoronavirus; Consensus; Coronavirus Infections; Delphi Technique; Endoscopy, Gastrointestinal; Gastrointestinal Diseases; Humans; Pandemics; Patient Selection; Pneumonia, Viral; Time Factors; Triage",2020-09,2020,92,3,535-542,All OA; Gold,Article,"Sawhney, Mandeep S.; Bilal, Mohammad; Pohl, Heiko; Kushnir, Vladimir; Khashab, Mouen A.; Schulman, Allison R.; Berzin, Tyler M.; Chalal, Prabhleen; Muthusamy, V.

In 2016, the 194 Member States of the World Health Organization committed to eliminating viral hepatitis as a public health threat by 2030, with a particular focus on hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus infection. With only 10 years to go until the 2030 deadline is reached, and although much progress has been made towards elimination, there are still some important gaps in terms of policy and progress. In this Viewpoint, we asked a selection of scientists and clinicians working in the viral hepatitis field for their opinions on whether elimination of viral hepatitis by 2030 is feasible, what the key areas of progress are and what the focus for the next 10 years and beyond should be for viral hepatitis elimination.","J.-H.K. thanks D.-S.

This analysis provides insight into the possible implications of the policy actions taken in the region. Methods An in-depth review and analysis of available data from the DACH countries was conducted. Data was collected from official government sources whenever possible, and supplemented by information from international databases and local reports. The data was then analyzed to identify common patterns as well as significant divergences across the DACH region, especially in the area of health policy and technology use. Results The DACH countries faced similar epidemiological situations during the Covid-19 pandemic, and were largely successful at preventing many of the negative impacts seen across the rest of Europe. Although many differences in health systems and governance structures existed, the policy responses in all three countries managed to address some of the most important factors in containing an infectious disease outbreak of this magnitude. Conclusions The actions taken by all three DACH countries appear to have been largely successful in reducing the health impact of Covid-19, allowing a return to normal economic activities much earlier than in neighboring countries. However, the implications of certain policies related to economic resilience and health system capacity cannot yet be fully evaluated and may even prove to have negative impacts into the future.",,Health Policy and Technology,,,2020-09,2020,,,,All OA; Gold,Article,"Desson, Zachary; Lambertz, Lisa; Peters, Jan Willem; Falkenbach, Michelle; Kauer, Lukas","Desson, Zachary (Erasmus University Rotterdam); Lambertz, Lisa (Erasmus University Rotterdam); Peters, Jan Willem (Erasmus University Rotterdam); Falkenbach, Michelle (University of Michigan); Kauer, Lukas (CSS Institute for Empirical Health Economics, University of Lucerne, University of Zürich)","Desson, Zachary (Erasmus University Rotterdam)","Desson, Zachary (Erasmus University Rotterdam); Lambertz, Lisa (Erasmus University Rotterdam); Peters, Jan Willem (Erasmus University Rotterdam); Falkenbach, Michelle (University of Michigan); Kauer, Lukas ()",Erasmus University Rotterdam; University of Michigan,grid.6906.9; grid.214458.e,Netherlands; United States,,0,0,,,6,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.hlpt.2020.09.003,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1130689192,1117 Public Health and Health Services; 11 Medical and Health Sciences,

DESIGN AND SETTING: The authors sent an anonymous survey to all obstetrics and gynecology applicants registered through the Electronic Residency Application Service in February 2020 asking respondents to share demographics and number of interview offers received and completed. Based on prior estimates that 12 interviews are needed to match in obstetrics and gynecology, respondents were divided into Group 12+ (those receiving ≥12 interview offers) and Group <12 (those receiving <12 offers). Model assumptions were (1) applicants can complete all interviews they are offered because they are virtual; (2) interview offers that applicants in Group 12+ decline are subsequently offered to applicants in Group <12; (3) the proportions of interviews offered to Group 12+ and Group <12 will remain the same if programs chose to increase their total number of interview spots. PARTICIPANTS: Among 2508 applicants, 750 (30%) provided the number of interview offers received and completed: 417 (56%) in Group 12+ and 333 (44%) in Group <12. RESULTS: In models where applicants are uncapped in the number of interviews, Group <12 applicants receive <1 interview offer, even if programs increase the number of interviews offered and performed. If applicants are capped at 12 interviews, Group <12 applicants will receive 9 interview offers on average and will reach 12 if programs increase the number of interviews offered by 20%. CONCLUSIONS: This work highlights how current inefficiencies may lead to negative consequences with virtual interviews. Interview caps and preference signaling systems need to be urgently considered.","The authors are grateful to the work of the entire Association of Professors of Gynecology and Obstetrics Council on Resident Education in Obstetrics and Gynecology RRR Grant Team: Molly Geogakis, Mark Woodland, Jessica Bienstock, Nadine T.

2,pub.1129711442,10.1038/s43017-020-0079-1,,,The COVID-19 lockdowns: a window into the Earth System,"Restrictions to reduce human interaction have helped to avoid greater suffering and death from the COVID-19 pandemic, but have also created socioeconomic hardship. This disruption is unprecedented in the modern era of global observing networks, pervasive sensing and large-scale tracking of human mobility and behaviour, creating a unique test bed for understanding the Earth System. In this Perspective, we hypothesize the immediate and long-term Earth System responses to COVID-19 along two multidisciplinary cascades: energy, emissions, climate and air quality; and poverty, globalization, food and biodiversity. While short-term impacts are dominated by direct effects arising from reduced human activity, longer-lasting impacts are likely to result from cascading effects of the economic recession on global poverty, green investment and human behaviour. These impacts offer the opportunity for novel insight, particularly with the careful deployment of targeted data collection, coordinated model experiments and solution-oriented randomized controlled trials, during and after the pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused substantial global impact. This Perspective provides insight into the environmental effects of the pandemic, documenting how it offers an opportunity to better understand the Earth System.","This article grew from discussions initiated in the Uncommon Dialogue programme of the Stanford Woods Institute for the Environment.

We focus on the challenges of understanding the complex chemistry that takes place on indoor surfaces and identify crucial steps necessary to gain a molecular-level understanding of environmental indoor surface chemistry: (1) elucidate key surface reaction mechanisms and kinetics important to indoor air chemistry, (2) define a range of relevant and representative surfaces to probe, and (3) define the drivers of surface reactivity, particularly with respect to the surface composition, light, and temperature. Within the drivers of surface composition are the roles of adsorbed/absorbed water associated with indoor surfaces and the prevalence, inhomogeneity, and properties of secondary organic films that can impact surface reactivity. By combining laboratory studies, field measurements, and modeling we can gain insights into the molecular processes necessary to further our understanding of the indoor environment.","Dr. Paula Olsiewski is acknowledged for her leadership of the Chemistry of Indoor Environments program, which enabled this review.

It remains unclear if there is a key step in this process that controls viral infectivity. To address this question, we use single-particle tracking and Brownian dynamics simulation to examine human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection in cell culture. We find that the frequency of viral-cell encounters is consistent with diffusion-limited interactions. However, even under the most favorable conditions, only 1% of the viruses can become immobilized on cell surface and subsequently enter the cell. This is a result of weak interaction between viral surface gp120 and CD4 receptor, which is insufficient to form a stable complex the majority of the time. We provide the first direct quantitation for efficiencies of these events relevant to measured HIV-1 infectivity and demonstrate that immobilization on host cell surface post-virion-diffusion is the key step in viral infection. Variation of its probability controls the efficiency of a virus to infect its host cells. These results explain the low infectivity of cell-free HIV-1 in vitro and offer a potential rationale for the pervasive high efficiency of cell-to-cell transmission of animal viruses.","We acknowledge NIH/NIAID Grant No. 1R21AI135559-01A1 to W.

As health care professionals dedicated to understanding and alleviating disease, many radiation oncologists have failed to acknowledge how structural racism affects the health and well-being of the patients we aim to serve. The literature is full of descriptive statistics showing the higher incidence and mortality experienced by the Black population for health conditions ranging from infant mortality to infectious disease, including coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Acknowledgment that the root of health disparities experienced by Black people in this country are based in racism is essential to moving the nation and the field of radiation oncology forward. With this lens, a brief overview of structural and institutional racism shapes a discussion of what radiation oncologists and the organizations that represent them can do to address this scourge. As members of a technological field, we often harness the power of data to advance human health and approach challenging diseases with optimism that multidisciplinary effort can produce cure. A few principles to mitigate the longstanding issues of Black marginalization within the field have been recommended via the ATIP (Acknowledgment, Transparency, Intentionality, and rePresentation) and LEADS (Learn, Engage, Advocate, Defend, Support) approaches. However, additional introspection is encouraged. Just as individuals, practices, and organizations rallied to determine how best to address the issues related to the COVID-19 pandemic, the same investigational fervor must be applied to the issue of racism to combat this sinister and often deadly disease.",,Advances in Radiation Oncology,,,2020-09,2020,5,5,783-790,All OA; Gold,Article,"Chapman, Christina Hunter; Gabeau, Darlene; Pinnix, Chelsea C.; Deville, Curtiland; Gibbs, Iris C.; Winkfield, Karen M.","Chapman, Christina Hunter (Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI); Gabeau, Darlene (Department of Radiation Oncology, William E.

Few data exist examining the use of telehealth compared with traditional settings. Bridging this gap is critical to optimizing telehealth use and reducing barriers. STUDY DESIGN: This is a retrospective cohort study of return and postoperative (electronic video [eClinic] and traditional) visits from January 2018 to March 2020 at single tertiary care center. There were 12,359 unique first-encounter patients with 903 eClinic and 11,456 traditional visits; 11,547 patients completed visits, while 812 patients did not show up. Multivariable logistic regression modeling was performed to identify factors associated with no-show. County-level mapping was used to identify patterns in no-show rates. RESULTS: Patients from the eClinic had twice the odds of no-show compared with those from a traditional clinic (p < 0.001).

Of importance are aviation emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), water vapor, soot and sulfate aerosols, and increased cloudiness due to contrail formation. Aviation grew strongly over the past decades (1960-2018) in terms of activity, with revenue passenger kilometers increasing from 109 to 8269 billion km yr-1, and in terms of climate change impacts, with CO2 emissions increasing by a factor of 6.8-1034 Tg CO2 yr-1. Over the period 2013-2018, the growth rates in both terms show a marked increase. Here, we present a new comprehensive and quantitative approach for evaluating aviation climate forcing terms. Both radiative forcing (RF) and effective radiative forcing (ERF) terms and their sums are calculated for the years 2000-2018. Contrail cirrus, consisting of linear contrails and the cirrus cloudiness arising from them, yields the largest positive net (warming) ERF term followed by CO2 and NOx emissions. The formation and emission of sulfate aerosol yields a negative (cooling) term. The mean contrail cirrus ERF/RF ratio of 0.42 indicates that contrail cirrus is less effective in surface warming than other terms. For 2018 the net aviation ERF is +100.9 mW (mW) m-2 (5-95% likelihood range of (55, 145)) with major contributions from contrail cirrus (57.4 mW m-2), CO2 (34.3 mW m-2), and NOx (17.5 mW m-2). Non-CO2 terms sum to yield a net positive (warming) ERF that accounts for more than half (66%) of the aviation net ERF in 2018. Using normalization to aviation fuel use, the contribution of global aviation in 2011 was calculated to be 3.5 (4.0, 3.4) % of the net anthropogenic ERF of 2290 (1130, 3330) mW m-2. Uncertainty distributions (5%, 95%) show that non-CO2 forcing terms contribute about 8 times more than CO2 to the uncertainty in the aviation net ERF in 2018. The best estimates of the ERFs from aviation aerosol-cloud interactions for soot and sulfate remain undetermined. CO2-warming-equivalent emissions based on global warming potentials (GWP* method) indicate that aviation emissions are currently warming the climate at approximately three times the rate of that associated with aviation CO2 emissions alone. CO2 and NOx aviation emissions and cloud effects remain a continued focus of anthropogenic climate change research and policy discussions.","We gratefully acknowledge discussions with many colleagues during the preparation of this paper, in particular Andreas Bier and Bernd Kärcher.

In this essay, we draw on our collective expertise to illustrate how a life course perspective can make critical contributions to understanding the pandemic’s effects on individuals, families, and populations. We explore the pandemic’s implications for the organization and experience of life transitions and trajectories within and across central domains: health, personal control and planning, social relationships and family, education, work and careers, and migration and mobility. We consider both the life course implications of being infected by the Covid-19 virus or attached to someone who has; and being affected by the pandemic’s social, economic, cultural, and psychological consequences. It is our goal to offer some programmatic observations on which life course research and policies can build as the pandemic’s short- and long-term consequences unfold.","Special thanks are extended to Jane Falkingham, Johannes Huinink, and Michael Shanahan for their thoughtful comments, and to Kara McElvaine for her help managing the project.

0,pub.1129573099,10.1002/sej.1363,,,Entrepreneurship in emerging economies,"The economic center of gravity is shifting from mature markets to emerging regions. This shift provides a good opportunity to broaden and deepen our theoretical base of concepts and frameworks because emerging and mature regions differ significantly in their institutional regimes. Hence entrepreneurial resource mobilization in emerging regions could differ significantly because of theoretical differences in actors' action logics and resource governance. The eight papers in this special issue provide new empirical evidence on antecedents and consequences of entrepreneurial resource mobilization efforts in emerging regions. Here, we briefly summarize the state of the field, introduce the articles by situating them in a novel theoretical framework on entrepreneurial resource mobilization, and finally using our framework, we suggest opportunities for future research on entrepreneurship in emerging regions. Entrepreneurship research has advanced mainly using empirical data from the developed economies of North America and Western Europe. Because emerging economies differ markedly in their institutional development from developed economies, this prior research is less likely to be useful to understand entrepreneurship in emerging regions ‐ which are increasingly crucial components of the global economy. This special issue contains eight articles addressing different aspects of the entrepreneurial resource mobilization process using diverse research methods on empirical data drawn from a broad range of emerging economies. This introduction describes the state of the field prior to the special issue, introduces the special issue articles and identifies topics that still need further investigation. We distill the current state of knowledge and offer a roadmap for future scholarship.",,Strategic Entrepreneurship Journal,,,2020-09,2020,14,3,289-301,Closed,Article,"Foo, Maw‐Der; Vissa, Balagopal; Wu, Brian","Foo, Maw‐Der (Nanyang Business School, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, Singapore); Vissa, Balagopal (INSEAD, Singapore); Wu, Brian (Stephen M.

Limited research exists regarding adherence with code status. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to characterize cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) attempts discordant with documented code status at the time of death in the U.S. and to elucidate potential contributing factors. METHODS: The Cerner Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) outcomes database, which includes 237 U.S. hospitals that collect manually abstracted data from all critical care patients, was queried for adults admitted to intensive care units with a documented code status at the time of death from January 2008 to December 2016. The primary outcome was discordant CPR at death. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to identify patient-level and hospital-level associated factors after adjustment for age, hospital, and illness severity (APACHE III score). RESULTS: A total of 21,537 patients from 56 hospitals were included. Of patients with a do-not-resuscitate code status, 149 (0.8%) received CPR at death, and associated factors included black race, higher APACHE III score, or treatment in small or nonteaching hospitals. Of patients with a full code status, 203 (9.0%) did not receive CPR at death, and associated factors included higher APACHE III score, primary neurologic or trauma diagnosis, or admission in a more recent year. CONCLUSION: At the time of death, 1.6% of patients received or did not undergo CPR in a manner discordant with their documented code statuses. Race and institutional factors were associated with discordant resuscitation, and addressing these disparities may promote concordant end-of-life care in all patients.",,Journal of Pain and Symptom Management,,,2020-09,2020,,,,Closed,Article,"Robbins, Alexandria J; Ingraham, Nicholas E; Sheka, Adam C; Pendleton, Kathryn M; Morris, Rachel; Rix, Alexander; Vakayil, Victor; Chipman, Jeffrey G; Charles, Anthony; Tignanelli, Christopher J","Robbins, Alexandria J (Department of Surgery, University of Minnesota Medical School, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA.

Drug repurposing, as an efficient way for drug development, has received a lot of attention. However, the huge amount of studies makes it challenging to keep up to date with the literature on COVID-19 therapeutic development. This review addresses this challenge by grouping the COVID-19 drug repurposing research into three large groups, including clinical trials, computational research, and in vitro protein-binding experiments. Particularly, to facilitate future drug discovery and the creation of effective drug combinations, drugs are organized by their mechanisms of action and reviewed by their efficacy measured by clinical trials.

Short-term applications include rapid case identification and contact tracing to limit viral spread, while population screening to determine the extent of viral infection across communities is a longer-term need. Assays developed to address these needs should match the ASSURED criteria. We have identified agglutination tests based on the commonly employed blood typing methods as a viable option. These blood typing tests are employed in hospitals worldwide, are high-throughput, fast (10-30 min), and automated in most cases. Herein, we describe the application of agglutination assays to SARS-CoV-2 serology testing by combining column agglutination testing with peptide-antibody bioconjugates, which facilitate red cell cross-linking only in the presence of plasma containing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. This simple, rapid, and easily scalable approach has immediate application in SARS-CoV-2 serological testing and is a useful platform for assay development beyond the COVID-19 pandemic.",,ACS Sensors,,"Agglutination Tests;

This review discusses current evidence regarding the pathophysiology, transmission, diagnosis, and management of COVID-19. Observations: SARS-CoV-2 is spread primarily via respiratory droplets during close face-to-face contact. Infection can be spread by asymptomatic, presymptomatic, and symptomatic carriers. The average time from exposure to symptom onset is 5 days, and 97.5% of people who develop symptoms do so within 11.5 days. The most common symptoms are fever, dry cough, and shortness of breath. Radiographic and laboratory abnormalities, such as lymphopenia and elevated lactate dehydrogenase, are common, but nonspecific. Diagnosis is made by detection of SARS-CoV-2 via reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction testing, although false-negative test results may occur in up to 20% to 67% of patients; however, this is dependent on the quality and timing of testing. Manifestations of COVID-19 include asymptomatic carriers and fulminant disease characterized by sepsis and acute respiratory failure. Approximately 5% of patients with COVID-19, and 20% of those hospitalized, experience severe symptoms necessitating intensive care. More than 75% of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 require supplemental oxygen. Treatment for individuals with COVID-19 includes best practices for supportive management of acute hypoxic respiratory failure. Emerging data indicate that dexamethasone therapy reduces 28-day mortality in patients requiring supplemental oxygen compared with usual care (21.6% vs 24.6%; age-adjusted rate ratio, 0.83 [95% CI, 0.74-0.92]) and that remdesivir improves time to recovery (hospital discharge or no supplemental oxygen requirement) from 15 to 11 days. In a randomized trial of 103 patients with COVID-19, convalescent plasma did not shorten time to recovery. Ongoing trials are testing antiviral therapies, immune modulators, and anticoagulants. The case-fatality rate for COVID-19 varies markedly by age, ranging from 0.3 deaths per 1000 cases among patients aged 5 to 17 years to 304.9 deaths per 1000 cases among patients aged 85 years or older in the US. Among patients hospitalized in the intensive care unit, the case fatality is up to 40%. At least 120 SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are under development. Until an effective vaccine is available, the primary methods to reduce spread are face masks, social distancing, and contact tracing. Monoclonal antibodies and hyperimmune globulin may provide additional preventive strategies. Conclusions and Relevance: As of July 1, 2020, more than 10 million people worldwide had been infected with SARS-CoV-2. Many aspects of transmission, infection, and treatment remain unclear. Advances in prevention and effective management of COVID-19 will require basic and clinical investigation and public health and clinical interventions.",,JAMA,,"Betacoronavirus; Clinical Laboratory Techniques; Coronavirus Infections; Global Health; Health Status Disparities; Hospital Mortality; Humans; Lung; Oxygen Inhalation Therapy; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Prognosis; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction; Viral Vaccines",2020-08-25,2020,324,8,782-793,All OA; Gold,Article,"Wiersinga, W.

Examining the perceived disclosure risk of maps and its implications for geoprivacy protection,"This research examines how people subjectively perceive the disclosure risk of a map using original data collected in an online survey with 856 participants. The results indicate that perceived disclosure risk increases as the amount of locational information displayed on a map increases. Compared to point-based maps, perceived disclosure risk is significantly lower for kernel density maps, convex hull maps, and standard deviational ellipse maps. The results also revealed that perceived disclosure risk is affected by map scale and the presence of information of other people on a map. For geomasking methods, perceived disclosure risk decreases as aggregation level increases and as relocation distance increases. However, aggregation methods (point to polygon) are more effective in preventing the re-identification of individuals when compared to relocation methods (point to point). Lastly, the perceived disclosure risk of a map that displays socially-vulnerable people is significantly higher than that of a map that displays non-vulnerable groups. Specifically, a map displaying the private locations of elementary school students has the highest perceived disclosure risk. Based on the results, a set of geoprivacy protection guidelines for mapping people’s private locations to minimize people’s perceived disclosure risk is proposed. Implications for mapping infectious diseases like the COVID-19 are also discussed.","Junghwan Kim would like to thank the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) Space-Time Analysis and Research (STAR) Lab members (Lirong Kou, Dong Liu, Wataru Morioka, and Shuangshuang Qiu), Yonsei University Gateway to City (GTC) Society members (Younghun Bahk, Hoyeon Hwang, Minseok Kim, and Youngjoon Kim), Soomin Kim, Rebecca Martin, Swati Rastogi, and Minsoo Sung for their helpful feedback during a pilot study.

We determined prevalence and predictors of empiric antibacterial therapy and community-onset bacterial co-infections in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. METHODS: Randomly sampled cohort of 1705 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in 38 Michigan hospitals between 3/13/2020-6/18/2020. Data were collected on early (prescribed within 2 days of hospitalization) empiric antibacterial therapy and community-onset bacterial co-infections (positive culture or diagnostic test within 3 days). Poisson generalized estimating equation models were used to assess predictors of empiric antibacterial use. RESULTS: Of 1705 patients with COVID-19, 56.6% were prescribed early empiric antibacterial therapy; 3.5% (59/1705) had a confirmed community-onset bacterial infection. Across hospitals, early empiric antibacterial use varied from 27%-84%.

This is likely caused by a hot blob of plasma ejected from Betelgeuse and then cooled to obscuring dust. If true, it is a remarkable opportunity to directly witness the formation of dust around a red supergiant star. Today's optical telescope facilities are not optimized for monitoring the Betelgeuse surface, so in this work, we propose a low-cost optical interferometer. The facility will consist of 12 x 4 inch optical telescopes mounted to the surface of a large radio dish for model-independent aperture synthesis imaging; polarization-maintaining single-mode fibers will carry the coherent beams from the individual optical telescopes to an all-in-one beam combiner. A fast steering mirror assisted fiber injection system guides the flux into fibers. A metrology system senses vibration-induced piston errors in optical fibers, and these errors are corrected using fast-steering delay lines.

Phage display is a powerful tool that can be used to discover peptide sequences with high affinity for a desired target. When incorporated into biomaterial design, peptides identified via phage display can functionalize material surfaces to control the interaction between a biomaterial and its local microenvironment. A targeting peptide has high specificity for a given target, allowing for homing a specific protein, cell, tissue, or other material to a biomaterial. A functional peptide has an affinity for a given protein, cell, or tissue, but also modulates its target's activity upon binding. Biomaterials can be further enhanced using a combination of targeting and/or functional peptides to create dual-functional peptides for bridging two targets or modulating the behavior of a specific protein or cell.

While state Medicaid programs are currently expanding coverage policies and enrollment to address acute public health needs, states will soon face significant budget shortfalls. These impending changes may renew partisan debates about restrictive policies like work requirements, which generally require beneficiaries to verify their participation in certain activities-such as employment, job search, or training programs-in order to receive or retain coverage. We argue that restrictive Medicaid policies are driven, to a great extent, by political party affiliation, highlighting the outsized role of partisanship in Medicaid policy adoption. To combat these dynamics, additional efforts are needed to improve community-informed decision-making, strengthen evaluation approaches to tie evidence to policymaking, and boost participation in and understanding of the political processes that affect policy change.",The authors thank Michael Fichman and Janet Weiner for their insights and expertise on prior related work.,Journal of General Internal Medicine,,"Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Health Policy; Humans; Medicaid; Pandemics; Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act; Pneumonia, Viral; Politics; United States",2020-08-19,2020,35,10,1-3,All OA; Gold,Article,"Zhu, Jane M.; Grande, David; Jones, David K.; Tipirneni, Renuka","Zhu, Jane M.

Although the majority of SARS-CoV-2 infections in pediatric populations result in minimal or mild COVID-19 in the acute phase of infection, a small subset of children develop severe and even critical disease in this phase with concomitant inflammation that may benefit from immunomodulation. Therefore, guidance is needed regarding immunomodulatory therapies in the setting of acute pediatric COVID-19. This document does not provide guidance regarding the recently emergent multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). METHODS: A multidisciplinary panel of pediatric subspecialty physicians and pharmacists with expertise in infectious diseases, rheumatology, hematology/oncology, and critical care medicine was convened. Guidance statements were developed based on best available evidence and expert opinion. RESULTS: The panel devised a framework for considering the use of immunomodulatory therapy based on an assessment of clinical disease severity and degree of multi-organ involvement combined with evidence of hyperinflammation. Additionally, the known rationale for consideration of each immunomodulatory approach and the associated risks and benefits was summarized. CONCLUSIONS: Immunomodulatory therapy is not recommended for the majority of pediatric patients, who typically develop mild or moderate COVID-19. For children with severe or critical illness, the use of immunomodulatory agents may be beneficial. The risks and benefits of such therapies are variable and should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis with input from appropriate specialty services. When available, the panel strongly favors immunomodulatory agent use within the context of clinical trials. The framework presented herein offers an approach to decision-making regarding immunomodulatory therapy for severe or critical pediatric COVID-19 and is informed by currently available data, while awaiting results of placebo-controlled randomized clinical trials.",,Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society,,,2020-08-18,2020,,,piaa098-,All OA; Gold,Article,"Dulek, Daniel E; Fuhlbrigge, Robert C; Tribble, Alison C; Connelly, James A; Loi, Michele M; Chebib, Hassan El; Chandrakasan, Shanmuganathan; Otto, William R; Diorio, Caroline; Keim, Garrett; Walkovich, Kelly; Jaggi, Preeti; Girotto, Jennifer E; Yarbrough, April; Behrens, Edward M; Cron, Randy Q; Bassiri, Hamid","Dulek, Daniel E (Division of Pediatric Infectious Diseases, Department of Pediatrics, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN); Fuhlbrigge, Robert C (Section of Rheumatology, Department of Pediatrics, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, CO); Tribble, Alison C (Division of Pediatric Infectious Diseases, Department of Pediatrics, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI); Connelly, James A (Division of Pediatric Hematology Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN); Loi, Michele M (Division of Pediatric Critical Care Medicine, Department of Pediatrics, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Denver, CO); Chebib, Hassan El (Division of Infectious Diseases and Immunology, Department of Pediatrics, Connecticut Children’s, Hartford, CT); Chandrakasan, Shanmuganathan (Division of Pediatric Hematology Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA); Otto, William R (Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Pediatrics, Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA); Diorio, Caroline (Division of Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA); Keim, Garrett (Division of Critical Care Medicine, Department of Pediatrics, Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA); Walkovich, Kelly (Division of Pediatric Hematology Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI); Jaggi, Preeti (Division of Pediatric Infectious Diseases, Department of Pediatrics, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA); Girotto, Jennifer E (Division of Infectious Diseases and Immunology, Department of Pediatrics, Connecticut Children’s, Hartford, CT; University of Connecticut School of Pharmacy, Storrs, CT); Yarbrough, April (Department of Pharmacy, Children’s of Alabama, Birmingham, AL); Behrens, Edward M (Division of Pediatric Rheumatology, Department of Pediatrics, Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA); Cron, Randy Q (Division of Pediatric Rheumatology, Department of Pediatrics, UAB School of Medicine, Birmingham, AL); Bassiri, Hamid (Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Pediatrics, Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA)",,"Dulek, Daniel E (Vanderbilt University Medical Center); Fuhlbrigge, Robert C (University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus); Tribble, Alison C (University of Michigan); Connelly, James A (Vanderbilt University Medical Center); Loi, Michele M (University of Colorado Denver); Chebib, Hassan El (); Chandrakasan, Shanmuganathan (Emory University); Otto, William R (); Diorio, Caroline (); Keim, Garrett (); Walkovich, Kelly (University of Michigan); Jaggi, Preeti (Emory University); Girotto, Jennifer E (University of Connecticut); Yarbrough, April (Children's of Alabama); Behrens, Edward M (); Cron, Randy Q (University of Alabama at Birmingham); Bassiri, Hamid ()",University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus; University of Colorado Denver; Emory University; University of Connecticut; Children's of Alabama; Vanderbilt University Medical Center; University of Michigan; University of Alabama at Birmingham,grid.430503.1; grid.241116.1; grid.189967.8; grid.63054.34; grid.413963.a; grid.412807.8; grid.214458.e; grid.265892.2,United States; United States; United States; United States; United States; United States; United States; United States,National Heart Lung and Blood Institute,1,1,,,25,https://academic.oup.com/jpids/advance-article-pdf/doi/10.1093/jpids/piaa098/33767420/piaa098.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1130052064,11 Medical and Health Sciences; 1103 Clinical Sciences,

But, as federal, state and local governments begin opening businesses and relaxing shelter-in-place orders worldwide, we lack quantitative evidence on how policies in one region affect mobility and social distancing in other regions and the consequences of uncoordinated regional policies adopted in the presence of such spillovers. To investigate this concern, we combined daily, county-level data on shelter-in-place policies with movement data from over 27 million mobile devices, social network connections among over 220 million Facebook users, daily temperature and precipitation data from 62,000 weather stations, and county-level census data on population demographics to estimate the geographic and social network spillovers created by regional policies across the United States. Our analysis shows that the contact patterns of people in a given region are significantly influenced by the policies and behaviors of people in other, sometimes distant, regions. When just one-third of a state's social and geographic peer states adopt shelter-in-place policies, it creates a reduction in mobility equal to the state's own policy decisions. These spillovers are mediated by peer travel and distancing behaviors in those states. A simple analytical model calibrated with our empirical estimates demonstrated that the ""loss from anarchy"" in uncoordinated state policies is increasing in the number of noncooperating states and the size of social and geographic spillovers. These results suggest a substantial cost of uncoordinated government responses to COVID-19 when people, ideas, and media move across borders.","We are grateful to the MIT Initiative on the Digital Economy and the MIT Social Analytics Lab for their support.

Few reports exist in Latin America, a current epicenter of transmission. Here, we aim to describe the epidemiology and outcomes associated with COVID-19 in Honduras. METHODS: Baseline clinical and epidemiological information of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR confirmed cases detected between March 17th-May 4th in the San Pedro Sula Metropolitan area was collected, and, for hospitalized cases, clinical data was abstracted. Logistic regression models were fit to determine factors associated with hospitalization. RESULTS: 877 COVID-19 cases were identified of which 25% (n=220) were hospitalized. The 19-44-year age group (57.8%) and males (61.3%) were predominant in overall COVID-19 cases. 34% of the cases (n=299) had at least one pre-existing medical condition. Individuals aged 45-69 years [aOR= 4.05, 95% CI: 2.85-5.76], ≥70 years [aOR= 9.12, 95% CI:5.24-15.86], of male sex [aOR =1.72, CI 95%: 1.21-2.44] and those with a pre-existing condition [aOR= 2.12, 95% CI: 1.43-3.14] had a higher odd of hospitalization. Fifty percent of inpatients were hospitalized more than 7 days. Median length of hospitalization was 13 days [IQR: 8-29] among individuals aged 19-44 years, and 17 days [IQR: 11-24.6] among those aged 45-69. Forty-two percent of the fatal cases occurred among adults under 60 years old. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show that a high proportion of COVID-19 cases in Honduras occurred among younger adults, who also constituted a significant proportion of severe and fatal cases. Pre-existing conditions were associated with severe outcomes independently from age and were highly prevalent in Honduran COVID-19 cases.",,Clinical Infectious Diseases,,,2020-08-17,2020,,,ciaa1188-,All OA; Gold,Article,"Zuniga-Moya, Julio C; Norwood, Dalton Argean; Reyes, Luis Enrique Romero; Saavedra, Emilio Barrueto; Diaz, Roxana; Fajardo, Wendy Carolina; Pineda, Allan; Torres, Diana; Barahona, Rodolfo; Leiva, Said Omar; Hernandez, Pastora X; Silva, Hector; Leiva, Carlos Raul; Estrada, Lourdes; Barahona-Campos, Alma; Gordon, Aubree","Zuniga-Moya, Julio C (Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, USA); Norwood, Dalton Argean (Hospital de Occidente, Santa Rosa de Copan, Honduras); Reyes, Luis Enrique Romero (Hospital Dr. Mario Catarino Rivas, San Pedro Sula, Honduras); Saavedra, Emilio Barrueto (Hospital Dr. Mario Catarino Rivas, San Pedro Sula, Honduras); Diaz, Roxana (Hospital Dr. Leonardo Martinez Valenzuela, San Pedro Sula, Honduras); Fajardo, Wendy Carolina (Hospital Regional Nor-Occidental Instituto Hondureño de Seguridad Social, San Pedro Sula, Honduras); Pineda, Allan (Hospital Regional Nor-Occidental Instituto Hondureño de Seguridad Social, San Pedro Sula, Honduras); Torres, Diana (Hospital Dr. Leonardo Martinez Valenzuela, San Pedro Sula, Honduras); Barahona, Rodolfo (Universidad Católica de Honduras, San Pedro Sula, Honduras); Leiva, Said Omar (Universidad Católica de Honduras, San Pedro Sula, Honduras); Hernandez, Pastora X (Hospital Dr. Mario Catarino Rivas, San Pedro Sula, Honduras); Silva, Hector (Hospital Dr. Mario Catarino Rivas, San Pedro Sula, Honduras); Leiva, Carlos Raul (Hospital Dr. Leonardo Martinez Valenzuela, San Pedro Sula, Honduras); Estrada, Lourdes (Secretaría de Salud, Honduras); Barahona-Campos, Alma (Secretaría de Salud, Honduras); Gordon, Aubree (Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, USA)",,"Zuniga-Moya, Julio C (University of Michigan); Norwood, Dalton Argean (); Reyes, Luis Enrique Romero (); Saavedra, Emilio Barrueto (); Diaz, Roxana (); Fajardo, Wendy Carolina (); Pineda, Allan (); Torres, Diana (); Barahona, Rodolfo (Universidad Católica de Honduras Nuestra Señora Reina de la Paz); Leiva, Said Omar (Universidad Católica de Honduras Nuestra Señora Reina de la Paz); Hernandez, Pastora X (); Silva, Hector (); Leiva, Carlos Raul (); Estrada, Lourdes (Secretaria de Salud); Barahona-Campos, Alma (Secretaria de Salud); Gordon, Aubree (University of Michigan)",University of Michigan; Universidad Católica de Honduras Nuestra Señora Reina de la Paz; Secretaria de Salud,grid.214458.e; grid.441009.8; grid.490705.f,United States; Honduras; Honduras,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,0,0,,,53,https://academic.oup.com/cid/advance-article-pdf/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa1188/33825854/ciaa1188.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1130028994,1117 Public Health and Health Services; 11 Medical and Health Sciences,

Variance in protein sequence might lead to change in protein structure and interaction, then further affect the viral physiological characteristics, which could bring tremendous influence on the pandemic. In this study, we investigated 18 non-synonymous mutations in SARS-CoV-2 genome which incidence rates were all ≥1% as of July 15 th , 2020, then modeled the mutated protein structures and compared them with the reference ones. The results showed that four types of mutations could cause dramatic changes in protein structures (RMSD ≥5.0 Å), which were Q57H and G251V in open reading frames 3a (ORF3a), S194L and R203K/G204R in nucleocapsid (N). Next, we found that these mutations could affect the binding affinity of intraviral protein interactions. In addition, the hot spots within these docking complexes were altered, among which the mutation Q57H was involved in both Orf3a-Orf8 and Orf3a-S protein interactions. Besides, these mutations were widely distributed all over the world, and their occurrences fluctuated as time went on. Notably, the incidences of R203K/G204R in N and Q57H in Orf3a were both over 50% in some countries. Overall, our findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 mutations can change viral protein structure, binding affinity and hot spots of the interface, thereby may have impacts on SARS-CoV-2 transmission, diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19.","We thank Xiaoting Li (Columbia University, USA) for helpful advice on modeling analysis.

Despite the resurgences in positive cases after reopening businesses in May, the country is seeing a shift in mindset surrounding the pandemic as people have been eagerly trickling out from federally-mandated quarantine into restaurants, bars, and gyms across America. History can teach us about the past, and today's pandemic is no exception. Without a vaccine available, three lessons from the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic may arm us in our fight against COVID-19. First, those who survived the first wave developed immunity to the second wave, highlighting the potential of passive immunity-based treatments like convalescent plasma and cell-based therapy. Second, the long-term consequences of COVID-19 are unknown. Slow-progressive cases of the Spanish flu have been linked to bacterial pneumonia and neurological disorders later in life, emphasizing the need to reduce COVID-19 transmission. Third, the Spanish flu killed approximately 17 to 50 million people, and the lack of human response, overcrowding, and poor hygiene were key in promoting the spread and high mortality. Human behavior is the most important strategy for preventing the virus spread and we must adhere to proper precautions. This review will cover our current understanding of the pathology and treatment for COVID-19 and highlight similarities between past pandemics. By revisiting history, we hope to emphasize the importance of human behavior and innovative therapies as we wait for the development of a vaccine.

METHODS: Twitter data (N=82,893) related to both older adults and COVID-19 and dated from January 23 to May 20, 2020, were analyzed. We used a combination of data science methods (including Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count, supervised machine learning, topic modeling, and sentiment analysis), qualitative thematic analysis, and conventional statistics. RESULTS: The most common category in the coded tweets was ""personal opinions"" (66.2%), followed by ""informative"" (24.7%), ""jokes/ridicule"" (4.8%), and ""personal experiences"" (4.3%). The daily average of ageist content was 18%, with the highest of 52.8% on March 11, 2020. Specifically, more than one in ten (11.5%) tweets implied that the life of older adults is less valuable or downplayed the pandemic because it mostly harms older adults. A small proportion (4.6%) explicitly supported the idea of just isolating older adults. Almost three-quarters (72.9%) within ""jokes/ridicule"" targeted older adults, half of which were ""death jokes."" Also, 14 themes were extracted, such as perceptions of lockdown and risk. A bivariate Granger causality test suggested that informative tweets regarding at-risk populations increased the prevalence of tweets that downplayed the pandemic. DISCUSSION: Ageist content in the context of COVID-19 was prevalent on Twitter.

As governments and health care systems develop and update policies and guidelines regarding the allocation of resources, patients and families affected by chronic disabilities, including many neuromuscular disorders that affect children and young adults, have become alarmed at the possibility that they may be determined to have less favorable prognoses due to their underlying diagnoses and thus be assigned to lower priority groups. It is important for health care workers, policymakers, and government officials to be aware that the long-term prognoses for children and young adults with neuromuscular disorders are often more promising than previously believed due to a better understanding of the natural history of these diseases, benefits of multidisciplinary supportive care, and novel molecular therapies that can dramatically improve the disease course. Although the realities of a global pandemic have the potential to require a shift from our usual, highly individualistic standards of care to crisis standards of care, shifting priorities should nonetheless be informed by good facts. Resource allocation guidelines with the potential to affect children and young adults with neuromuscular disorders should take into account the known trajectory of acute respiratory illness in this population and rely primarily on contemporary long-term outcome data.",,Neurology,,"Betacoronavirus; Child; Clinical Decision-Making; Coronavirus Infections; Health Personnel; Humans; Neuromuscular Diseases; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral",2020-08-11,2020,95,6,10.1212/wnl.0000000000009936,All OA; Gold,Article,"Laventhal, Naomi T; Graham, Robert J; Rasmussen, Sonja A; Urion, David K; Kang, Peter B","Laventhal, Naomi T (From the Division of Neonatal-Perinatal Medicine (N.T.L.), Department of Pediatrics, University of Michigan School of Medicine and C.S.

Social distancing became the main policy for public behavior, in effect imposing radical changes in people’s everyday life. Thus, mental health may be affected at the general population level and not only among those who have been infected by the disease or have witnessed family members or close ones fall ill. Methods: A cross-sectional online survey was conducted in Norway, UK, USA and Australia during April/May 2020. Participants (n = 3810) were recruited via social media postings by the researchers and the involved universities. Differences between those with and without infection in the family were investigated with chi-square tests and independent t-tests. Multiple regression analyses were used to assess associations between sociodemographic variables and psychological outcomes (worry, loneliness and mental health) in both groups. Results: Compared to their counterparts, participants with infection in the family reported higher levels of worries about themselves (p < 0.05) and their family members (p < 0.001), and had poorer mental health (p < 0.05). However, the effect sizes related to the differences were small. The largest effect (d = 0.24) concerned worries about their immediate family. Poorer psychological outcomes were observed in those who were younger, female, unemployed, living alone and had lower levels of edcuation, yet with small effect sizes. Conclusions: In view of the small differences between those with and without infection, we generally conclude that the mental health effects of the COVID-19 situation are not limited to those who have been infected or have had infection within the family, but extend to the general population.",,Research Square,,,2020-08-11,2020,,,,"All OA; Green, Published",Preprint,"Bonsaksen, Tore; Leung, Janni; Schoultz, Mariyana; Thygesen, Hilde; Price, Daicia; Ruffolo, Mary; Geirdal, Amy Østertun","Bonsaksen, Tore (OsloMet - Oslo Metropolitan University); Leung, Janni (University of Queensland); Schoultz, Mariyana (University of Salford); Thygesen, Hilde (VID Vitenskapelige Hogskole); Price, Daicia (University of Michigan); Ruffolo, Mary (University of Michigan); Geirdal, Amy Østertun (Oslo Metropolitan University)",,"Bonsaksen, Tore (); Leung, Janni (University of Queensland); Schoultz, Mariyana (University of Salford); Thygesen, Hilde (); Price, Daicia (University of Michigan); Ruffolo, Mary (University of Michigan); Geirdal, Amy Østertun ()",University of Salford; University of Queensland; University of Michigan,grid.8752.8; grid.1003.2; grid.214458.e,United Kingdom; Australia; United States,,0,0,,,,https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-34850/v2.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1130044244,1117 Public Health and Health Services; 11 Medical and Health Sciences,

The historical foundation of the ethical responsibility of the physician to the patient rests on the of that individual relationship. The patient comes first. However, in a pandemic, a public health ethics takes over, and the focus changes to what each individual member of society’s responsibility is to the collective. The greatest good for the greatest number trumps a given individual’s needs. Ethicists have focused primarily on creating guidelines that apply to allocating scarce life-and-death-determining resources. Very little attention has been paid to scarce resources that are more mundane, such as personal protective equipment (PPE) or operating room (OR) time. I present here a summary of the most recent ethical guidelines for allocation of scarce resources, note some concerns with these approaches, and discuss some of the shortcomings of applying these frameworks to the practice of craniofacial surgeons.",,,,,2020-08-11,2020,,,273250162094919,All OA; Gold,Article,"Vercler, Christian J.","Vercler, Christian J.

However, little in-depth evidence is known about the application of ECMO therapy in COVID-19 patients.Methods This retrospective multicenter cohort study included 88 patients who had been diagnosed with COVID-19 and received ECMO therapy at seven designated hospitals in Wuhan, China. The clinical characteristics, laboratory examinations, treatments, and outcomes were extracted from electronic medical records and compared between weaned and non-weaned ECMO patients. The patients were followed until June 30, 2020. Logistic regression analyses were performed to identify the risk factors associated with unsuccessful ECMO weaning. Propensity score matching was used to match patients who received veno-venous ECMO with those who received invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV)-only therapy. The primary endpoint, 120-day all-cause mortality after intensive care unit (ICU) admission during hospitalization, was compared using a mixed-effect Cox model.Results Of 88 patients who received ECMO therapy, 27 and 61 patients were and were not successfully weaned from ECMO, respectively. Additionally, 15, 15, and 65 patients were further weaned from IMV, discharged from hospital, or died during hospitalization, respectively. A lymphocyte count ≤ 0.5 × 109/L and D-dimer concentration > 4 × the upper limit of normal at ICU admission, a peak PaCO2 > 60 mmHg at 24 hours before ECMO initiation, and no tracheotomy performed during the ICU stay were independently associated with lower odds of ECMO weaning. In the propensity score-matched analysis, a mixed-effect Cox model detected a lower hazard ratio for 120-day all-cause mortality after ICU admission during hospitalization in the ECMO group, as compared with the IMV-only group.Conclusion Patients in Wuhan who received ECMO therapy had a relatively high mortality rate. This outcome may be largely attributable to resource-limited situations during the COVID-19 outbreak. In future, the presence of lymphocytopenia and higher D-dimer concentrations at ICU admission and hypercapnia at 24 hours before ECMO initiation could help to identify patients with a poor prognosis. Moreover, tracheotomy could facilitate weaning from ECMO. Despite the high mortality, ECMO was associated with improved outcomes relative to IMV-only therapy in critically ill COVID-19 patients.",,Research Square,,,2020-08-10,2020,,,,"All OA; Green, Accepted & Submitted",Preprint,"Fang, Jing; Chen, Yue; Hu, Ming; Li, Rui; Qin, Juanjuan; Cheng, Lin; He, Yi; Li, Yi; Zhou, Qiang; Zhou, Daixing; Chen, Jun; Huang, Fei; Lei, Fang; Yang, Bo; Deng, Hongping; Yuan, Yufeng; Xia, Jiahong; Li, Hongliang; Huang, Chaolin; Wan, Song; Wei, Xiang","Fang, Jing (Tongji Hospital of Tongji Medical College of Huazhong University of Science and Technology); Chen, Yue (Tongji Hospital of Tongji Medical College of Huazhong University of Science and Technology); Hu, Ming (Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital); Li, Rui (Tongji Hospital of Tongji Medical College of Huazhong University of Science and Technology); Qin, Juanjuan (Wuhan University Basic Medical School); Cheng, Lin (Tongji Hospital of Tongji Medical College of Huazhong University of Science and Technology); He, Yi (Tongji Hospital of Tongji Medical College of Huazhong University of Science and Technology); Li, Yi (Tongji Hospital of Tongji Medical College of Huazhong University of Science and Technology); Zhou, Qiang (Tongji Hospital of Tongji Medical College of Huazhong University of Science and Technology); Zhou, Daixing (Tongji Hospital of Tongji Medical College of Huazhong University of Science and Technology); Chen, Jun (Tongji Hospital of Tongji Medical College of Huazhong University of Science and Technology); Huang, Fei (Tongji Hospital of Tongji Medical College of Huazhong University of Science and Technology); Lei, Fang (Wuhan University Basic Medical School); Yang, Bo (University of Michigan); Deng, Hongping (Wuhan University Renmin Hospital); Yuan, Yufeng (Wuhan University Zhongnan Hospital); Xia, Jiahong (Wuhan Union Hospital); Li, Hongliang (Wuhan University Basic Medical School); Huang, Chaolin (Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital); Wan, Song (Chinese University of Hong Kong); Wei, Xiang (Tongji Hospital of Tongji Medical College of Huazhong University of Science and Technology)",,"Fang, Jing (); Chen, Yue (); Hu, Ming (); Li, Rui (); Qin, Juanjuan (Wuhan University); Cheng, Lin (); He, Yi (); Li, Yi (); Zhou, Qiang (); Zhou, Daixing (); Chen, Jun (); Huang, Fei (); Lei, Fang (Wuhan University); Yang, Bo (University of Michigan); Deng, Hongping (); Yuan, Yufeng (); Xia, Jiahong (Wuhan Union Hospital); Li, Hongliang (Wuhan University); Huang, Chaolin (); Wan, Song (Chinese University of Hong Kong); Wei, Xiang ()",University of Michigan; Wuhan University; Chinese University of Hong Kong; Wuhan Union Hospital,grid.214458.e; grid.49470.3e; grid.10784.3a; grid.412839.5,United States; China; China; China,,0,0,,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1130021547,11 Medical and Health Sciences; 1103 Clinical Sciences,3 Good Health and Well Being

The effects of this sudden transition to distance learning affect multiple aspects of training, from recruitment to patient care, scholarly activity and well-being. Clinical educators must also understand how to consider and maintain equity while implementing distance learning strategies. METHODS: Resources were collected from multiple sites that are openly accessible to sleep medicine educators. These resources are listed by topic domain to provide guidance on how to effectively implement distance learning strategies into a clinical training program. RESULTS: Links to helpful resources are provided for each of the following topics: Virtual Clinical Care, Didactic Delivery in a Virtual Clinical Learning Environment, Generating Scholarship via Distance Learning, Well-being in the Setting of Distance Learning, Virtual Interviews, and Equity in a Virtual Clinical Learning Environment.

0,pub.1129926886,10.3389/frai.2020.00055,,,A Framework for the Computational Linguistic Analysis of Dehumanization,"Dehumanization is a pernicious psychological process that often leads to extreme intergroup bias, hate speech, and violence aimed at targeted social groups. Despite these serious consequences and the wealth of available data, dehumanization has not yet been computationally studied on a large scale. Drawing upon social psychology research, we create a computational linguistic framework for analyzing dehumanizing language by identifying linguistic correlates of salient components of dehumanization. We then apply this framework to analyze discussions of LGBTQ people in the New York Times from 1986 to 2015. Overall, we find increasingly humanizing descriptions of LGBTQ people over time. However, we find that the label homosexual has emerged to be much more strongly associated with dehumanizing attitudes than other labels, such as gay. Our proposed techniques highlight processes of linguistic variation and change in discourses surrounding marginalized groups. Furthermore, the ability to analyze dehumanizing language at a large scale has implications for automatically detecting and understanding media bias as well as abusive language online.","We would like to thank Rob Voigt, Chris Potts, Penny Eckert, David Jurgens, Ceren Budak, Anna-Marie Sprenger, and Ismael Mendoza for their insightful contributions and feedback.

METHODS: Faculty and staff were asked to volunteer stories, data, and photographs describing their activities from March through May 2020. The information was assembled into a narrative summary. RESULTS: Increased deaths challenged capacity limits in a hospital morgue and a large urban medical examiner's office (MEO) successfully managed by forensic teams and monitored by an institutional command center. Autopsies of suspected and proven cases of COVID-19 were performed in both facilities. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) testing of decedents was performed in a MEO serving a large urban area. Scene investigators worked directly with families to meet needs unique to a pandemic. Artful photographs of decedent's hands and/or tattoos were offered to those unable to have in-person viewings. Pathologists and social workers were available to families of the deceased and created novel solutions to facilitate the grieving process. CONCLUSIONS: Forensic pathology is important to successfully navigating emerging diseases like the COVID-19 pandemic. Direct conversations with families are common in forensic pathology and serve as a model for patient- and family-centered care.","The authors thank Michigan Medicine staff and faculty who contributed directly to information used in this article, including Lisbeth Harcourt, Dr Leigh Hlavaty, Dr Jeffrey Jentzen, Christine Rigney, Dr Carl Schmidt, LaCretia Thomas, Aimee Vantine, Dr Milad Webb, and Dr Allecia Wilson, and to Lisa Neal and Kelly Root for providing photographs.",American Journal of Clinical Pathology,,"Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Forensic Pathology; Health Personnel; Humans; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral",2020-08-05,2020,154,3,aqaa106-,All OA; Gold,Article,"Myers, Jeffrey L; Mulder, Lotte","Myers, Jeffrey L (Department of Pathology, Michigan Medicine, Ann Arbor); Mulder, Lotte (American Society for Clinical Pathology, Chicago, IL)",,"Myers, Jeffrey L (Michigan Medicine); Mulder, Lotte (American Society for Clinical Pathology)",Michigan Medicine; American Society for Clinical Pathology,grid.412590.b; grid.427735.0,United States; United States,,0,0,,,31,https://academic.oup.com/ajcp/article-pdf/154/3/286/33566537/aqaa106.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1128368278,1117 Public Health and Health Services; 11 Medical and Health Sciences,

As the pandemic persists, patients and their families struggle to identify the best and safest practices for resuming activities as areas reopen. Notably, decisions about returning to school remain difficult. We assembled a team of pediatric infectious diseases (ID), transplant ID, public health, transplant psychology, and infection prevention and control specialists to address the primary concerns about school reentry for pediatric SOT recipients in the United States. Based on available literature and guidance from national organizations, we generated consensus statements pertaining to school reentry specific to pediatric SOT recipients.

When caring for patients with tracheostomy, speech-language pathologists have significant exposure to mucosal surfaces, secretions, and aerosols that may harbor the SARS-CoV-2 virus. This tutorial provides guidance on practices for safely performing patient evaluation and procedures, thereby reducing risk of infection. Method Data were collated through review of literature, guidelines, and consensus statements relating to COVID-19 and similar high-consequent infections, with a focus on mitigating risk of transmission to health care workers. Particular emphasis was placed on speech-language pathologists, nurses, and other allied health professionals. A multinational interdisciplinary team then analyzed findings, arriving at recommendations through consensus via electronic communications and video conference. Results Reports of transmission of infection to health care workers in the current COVID-19 pandemic and previous outbreaks substantiate the need for safe practices. Many procedures routinely performed by speech-language pathologists have a significant risk of infection due to aerosol generation. COVID-19 testing can inform level of protective equipment, and meticulous hygiene can stem spread of nosocomial infection. Modifications to standard clinical practice in tracheostomy are often required. Personal protective equipment, including either powered air-purifying respirator or N95 mask, gloves, goggles, and gown, are needed when performing aerosol-generating procedures in patients with known or suspected COVID-19 infection. Conclusions Speech-language pathologists are often called on to assist in the care of patients with tracheostomy and known or suspected COVID-19 infection. Appropriate care of these patients is predicated on maintaining the health and safety of the health care team. Careful adherence to best practices can significantly reduce risk of infectious transmission.",,American Journal of Speech-Language Pathology,,"Betacoronavirus; Consensus; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Infectious Disease Transmission, Patient-to-Professional; Interdisciplinary Communication; International Cooperation; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Practice Guidelines as Topic; Speech-Language Pathology; Tracheostomy",2020-08-04,2020,29,3,1320-1334,All OA; Gold,Article,"Zaga, Charissa J.; Pandian, Vinciya; Brodsky, Martin B.; Wallace, Sarah; Cameron, Tanis S.; Chao, Caroline; Orloff, Lisa Ann; Atkins, Naomi E.; McGrath, Brendan A.; Lazarus, Cathy L.; Vogel, Adam P.; Brenner, Michael J.","Zaga, Charissa J.

However, attaining the combination of high sensitivity and multiplexity with a short assay turnaround poses a formidable technological challenge. Here, we developed a rapid, accurate, and highly multiplexed microfluidic digital immunoassay by incorporating machine learning-based autonomous image analysis. The assay achieved 14-plexed biomarker detection at concentrations < 10pg/mL with a sample volume < 10 μL, including all processes from sampling to analyzed data delivery within 30 min, while only requiring a 5-min assay incubation. The assay procedure applied both a spatial-spectral microfluidic encoding scheme and an image data analysis algorithm based on machine learning with a convolutional neural network (CNN) for pre-equilibrated single-molecule protein digital counting. This unique approach remarkably reduced errors facing the high-capacity multiplexing of digital immunoassay at low protein concentrations. Longitudinal data obtained for a panel of 14 serum cytokines in human patients receiving chimeric antigen receptor-T (CAR-T) cell therapy manifested the powerful biomarker profiling capability and great potential of the assay for its translation to near-real-time bedside immune status monitoring.","This study was supported by the National Science Foundation (CBET1931905), the U-M Precision Health Scholars Award (Y.S.), the A.

We sought to determine the effectiveness of a pulsed-xenon ultraviolet (PX-UV) disinfection system in reducing the load of SARS-CoV-2 on hard surfaces and N95 respirators. METHODS: Chamber slides and N95 respirator material were directly inoculated with SARS-CoV-2 and were exposed to different durations of PX-UV. RESULTS: For hard surfaces, disinfection for 1, 2, and 5 minutes resulted in 3.53 log10, >4.54 log10, and >4.12 log10 reductions in viral load, respectively. For N95 respirators, disinfection for 5 minutes resulted in >4.79 log10 reduction in viral load. PX-UV significantly reduced SARS-CoV-2 on hard surfaces and N95 respirators. CONCLUSION: With the potential to rapidly disinfectant environmental surfaces and N95 respirators, PX-UV devices are a promising technology to reduce environmental and personal protective equipment bioburden and to enhance both healthcare worker and patient safety by reducing the risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2.","Acknowledgments: The views expressed in this commentary are those of the authors and do not represent any position, policy, or opinion of the US Department of Veterans’ Affairs.

We analyze how media and political elites shaped public opinion of the two outbreaks. We conducted a retrospective analysis of media coverage, Congressional floor speech, and public opinion polls to explain elite cueing and public perceptions of Ebola and Zika. We find evidence of elite cueing by Congress and the media on public opinion. Public opinion of both disease outbreaks initially followed partisan patterns. However, while Ebola public opinion remained partisan, ultimately, opinion emerged of a bipartisan nature for Zika, mirroring elite framing. Public health officials should be aware of how elite cueing shapes policy and prioritizes partisan strategies. Politics and public opinion can focus attention on or away from infectious disease; it can also undermine public health responses by biasing the public's view of a diseases' relative risk.","For the research reported in this publication, we received support from the National Institute of Mental Health of the National Institutes of Health under Award Number T32MH019733.

In response, the U.S. Surgeon General, the American College of Srugeons, and other surgical professional societies recommended postponing elective surgical procedures and proceeding cautiously with cancer procedures that may require significant hospital resources and expose vulnerable patients to the virus. These challenges have particularly distressing for women with a gynecologic cancer diagnosis and their providers. Currently, circumstances vary greatly by region and by hospital, depending on COVID-19 prevalence, case mix, hospital type, and available resources. Therefore, COVID-19-related modifications to surgical practice guidelines must be individualized. Special consideration is necessary to evaluate the appropriateness of procedural interventions, recognizing the significant resources and personnel they require. Additionally, the pandemic may occur in waves, with patient demand for surgery ebbing and flowing accordingly. Hospitals, cancer centers and providers must prepare themselves to meet this demand. The purpose of this white paper is to highlight all phases of gynecologic cancer surgical care during the COVID-19 pandemic and to illustrate when it is best to operate, to hestitate, and reintegrate surgery.

Retrospective studies of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China, report an incidence of 3%-7% progressing to ARF, a marker of poor prognosis. The cause of the renal failure in COVID-19 is unknown, but one hypothesized mechanism is direct renal infection by the causative virus, SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: We performed an autopsy on a single patient who died of COVID-19 after open repair of an aortic dissection, complicated by hypoxic respiratory failure and oliguric renal failure. We used light and electron microscopy to examine renal tissue for evidence of SARS-CoV-2 within renal cells. RESULTS: Light microscopy of proximal tubules showed geographic isometric vacuolization, corresponding to a focus of tubules with abundant intracellular viral arrays. Individual viruses averaged 76 µm in diameter and had an envelope studded with crown-like, electron-dense spikes. Vacuoles contained double-membrane vesicles suggestive of partially assembled virus. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of viral particles in the renal tubular epithelium that were morphologically identical to SARS-CoV-2, and with viral arrays and other features of virus assembly, provide evidence of a productive direct infection of the kidney by SARS-CoV-2. This finding offers confirmatory evidence that direct renal infection occurs in the setting of AKI in COVID-19. However, the frequency and clinical significance of direct infection in COVID-19 is unclear. Tubular isometric vacuolization observed with light microscopy, which correlates with double-membrane vesicles containing vacuoles observed with electronic microscopy, may be a useful histologic marker for active SARS-CoV-2 infection in kidney biopsy or autopsy specimens.","None.

The number of victims continues to increase, and patients at risk can only be protected to a degree, because the virulent state may be asymptomatic. Risk factors concerning COVID-19-induced morbidity and mortality include advanced age, an impaired immune system, cardiovascular or pulmonary diseases, obesity, diabetes mellitus, and cancer treated with chemotherapy. Here, we discuss the risk and impact of COVID-19 in patients with mastocytosis and mast cell activation syndromes. Because no published data are yet available, expert opinions are, by necessity, based on case experience and reports from patients. Although the overall risk to acquire the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 may not be elevated in mast cell disease, certain conditions may increase the risk of infected patients to develop severe COVID-19. These factors include certain comorbidities, mast cell activation-related events affecting the cardiovascular or bronchopulmonary system, and chemotherapy or immunosuppressive drugs. Therefore, such treatments should be carefully evaluated on a case-by-case basis during a COVID-19 infection. In contrast, other therapies, such as anti-mediator-type drugs, venom immunotherapy, or vitamin D, should be continued. Overall, patients with mast cell disorders should follow the general and local guidelines in the COVID-19 pandemic and advice from their medical provider.",,Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology,,"Betacoronavirus; Comorbidity; Coronavirus Infections; Diphosphonates; Disease Management; Expert Testimony; Glucocorticoids; Histamine Antagonists; Humans; Immunosuppressive Agents; Mast Cells; Mastocytosis, Cutaneous; Mastocytosis, Systemic; Myeloablative Agonists; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Precision Medicine; Risk Factors; Vitamin D",2020-08,2020,146,2,300-306,All OA; Gold,Article,"Valent, Peter; Akin, Cem; Bonadonna, Patrizia; Brockow, Knut; Niedoszytko, Marek; Nedoszytko, Boguslaw; Butterfield, Joseph H.; Alvarez-Twose, Ivan; Sotlar, Karl; Schwaab, Juliana; Jawhar, Mohamad; Reiter, Andreas; Castells, Mariana; Sperr, Wolfgang R.; Kluin-Nelemans, Hanneke C.; Hermine, Olivier; Gotlib, Jason; Zanotti, Roberta; Broesby-Olsen, Sigurd; Horny, Hans-Peter; Triggiani, Massimo; Siebenhaar, Frank; Orfao, Alberto; Metcalfe, Dean D.; Arock, Michel; Hartmann, Karin","Valent, Peter (Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Haematology and Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Hematology and Oncology, Medical University of Vienna, Austria); Akin, Cem (Division of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA); Bonadonna, Patrizia (Allergy Unit, Verona University Hospital, Verona, Italy); Brockow, Knut (Department of Dermatology and Allergy Biederstein, Technical University of Munich, Germany); Niedoszytko, Marek (Department of Allergology, Medical University of Gdansk, Poland); Nedoszytko, Boguslaw (Department of Dermatology, Medical University of Gdansk, Poland); Butterfield, Joseph H.

Its rapid transmissibility has transformed healthcare delivery and forced countries to adopt strict measures to contain its spread. The vast majority of the United States cardiac surgical programs have deferred all but truly emergent/urgent operative procedures in an effort to reduce the burden on the healthcare system and to mobilize resources to combat the pandemic surge. While the number of COVID-19 cases continue to increase worldwide, the incidence of new cases has begun to decline in many North American cities. This ""flattening of the curve"" has prompted interest in reopening the economy, relaxing public health restrictions, and resuming nonurgent healthcare delivery. The following document provides a template whereby adult cardiac surgical programs may begin to ramp-up the care delivery in a deliberate and graded fashion as the COVID-19 pandemic burden begins to ease. ""Resuscitating"" the timely delivery of care is guided by three principles: (1) Collaborate to permit increased case volumes, balancing the clinical needs of patients awaiting surgical procedures with the local resources available within each healthcare system. (2) Prioritize patients awaiting elective procedures while proactively engaging all stakeholders, focusing on those with high-risk anatomy, changing/symptomatic clinical status, and, once these variables have been addressed, prioritizing by waiting times. (3) Reevaluate local conditions continuously to assess for any increase in admissions due to a recrudescence of cases, to assure adequate resources to care for patients, and to monitor in-hospital infectious transmissions to both patients and healthcare workers.",,The Annals of Thoracic Surgery,,"Advisory Committees; Betacoronavirus; Cardiac Surgical Procedures; Coronavirus Infections; Delivery of Health Care; Humans; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Surgeons; Thoracic Surgery",2020-08,2020,110,2,712-717,All OA; Gold,Article,"Engelman, Daniel T.; Lother, Sylvain; George, Isaac; Ailawadi, Gorav; Atluri, Pavan; Grant, Michael C.; Haft, Jonathan W.; Hassan, Ansar; Legare, Jean-Francois; Whitman, Glenn; Arora, Rakesh C.; Surgery, Society of Thoracic Surgeons COVID-19 Task Force and Workforce for Adult Cardiac and Vascular","Engelman, Daniel T.

They are a class of mathematical models widely used for describing the mechanism of an evolving epidemic. Integrated with certain sampling schemes, such mechanistic models can be applied to analyse public health surveillance data, such as assessing the effectiveness of preventive measures (e.g. social distancing and quarantine) and forecasting disease spread patterns. This review begins with a nationwide macromechanistic model and related statistical analyses, including model specification, estimation, inference and prediction. Then, it presents a community-level micromodel that enables high-resolution analyses of regional surveillance data to provide current and future risk information useful for local government and residents to make decisions on reopenings of local business and personal travels. r software and scripts are provided whenever appropriate to illustrate the numerical detail of algorithms and calculations. The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic surveillance data from the state of Michigan are used for the illustration throughout this paper.",The authors are very grateful to the co‐editors for the invitation to contribute a review paper for statistical modelling and analysis of infectious diseases and for their helpful feedback towards improving the manuscript.

The issue of ventilator allocation in pandemics has been reviewed by many medical ethicists, but as localities activate crisis standards of care, and health care workers are infected from patient exposure, the decision to pursue cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) must also be examined to better balance the increased risks to healthcare personnel with the very low resuscitation rates of patients infected with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) . A crisis standard of care that is equitable, transparent, and mindful of both human and physical resources will lessen the impact on society in this era of COVID-19. This paper builds on previous work of ventilator allocation in pandemic crises to propose a literature-based, justice-informed ethical framework for selecting treatment options for CPR. The pandemic affects regions differently over time, so these suggested guidelines may require adaptation to local practice variations.","The authors would like to thank the members of the American College of Emergency Physicians Public Health Injury Prevention Committee and Nicholas Johnson, MD, FACEP; Rebecca Barron, MD, MPH; Courtney Edwards, DNP, MPH, CCRN; and Margaret Montgomery, RN, MSN for their valuable feedback.",,,,2020-08,2020,1,4,408-415,All OA; Gold,Article,"Hsu, Antony; Weber, William; Heins, Alan; Josephson, Elaine; Kornberg, Robert; Diaz, Rosemarie","Hsu, Antony (Department of Emergency Medicine, St. Joseph Mercy Hospital, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA); Weber, William (Section of Emergency Medicine, The University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois, USA); Heins, Alan (Department of Emergency Medicine, University of South Alabama, Mobile, Alabama, USA); Josephson, Elaine (Department of Emergency Medicine, Lincoln Medical and Mental Health Center, Weill Cornell Medical College of Cornell University, Bronx, New York, USA); Kornberg, Robert (Division of Cardiology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, USA); Diaz, Rosemarie (Department of Emergency Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA)",,"Hsu, Antony (St Joseph Mercy Hospital); Weber, William (); Heins, Alan (University of South Alabama); Josephson, Elaine (Cornell University); Kornberg, Robert (Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai); Diaz, Rosemarie (University of Michigan)",Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai; Cornell University; St Joseph Mercy Hospital; University of South Alabama; University of Michigan,grid.59734.3c; grid.5386.8; grid.416444.7; grid.267153.4; grid.214458.e,United States; United States; United States; United States; United States,,0,0,,,3,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1002/emp2.12096,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1128427484,1117 Public Health and Health Services; 11 Medical and Health Sciences,

As graduating medical students who will soon begin residency, the authors fully support this recommendation. Though paid health care workers, like residents, nurses, and environmental services staff, are essential to the management of COVID-19 patients, medical students are not. Students' continued involvement in direct patient care will contribute to SARS-CoV-2 exposures and transmissions and will waste already limited personal protective equipment. By decreasing nonessential personnel in health care settings, including medical students, medical schools will contribute to national and global efforts to ""flatten the curve.""The authors also assert that medical schools are responsible for ensuring medical student safety. Without the protections provided to paid health care workers, students are uniquely disadvantaged within the medical hierarchy; these inequalities must be addressed before medical students are safely reintegrated into clinical roles. Although graduating medical students and institutional leadership may worry that suspending clinical rotations might prevent students from completing graduation requirements, the authors argue the ethical obligation to ""flatten the curve"" supersedes usual teaching responsibilities. Therefore, the authors request further guidance from the LCME and AAMC regarding curricular exemptions/alternatives and adjusted graduation timelines. The pool of graduating medical students affected by this pause in direct patient contact represents a powerful reserve, which may soon need to be used as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to challenge the U.S. health care infrastructure.",,Academic Medicine,,"Academic Medical Centers; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Education, Medical; Health Personnel; Humans; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Students, Medical; United States",2020-08,2020,95,8,1149-1151,"All OA; Green, Published",Article,"Menon, Anitha; Klein, Edwin J.; Kollars, Kate; Kleinhenz, Alissa L.W.","Menon, Anitha (A.

The 30-day window was adjusted to begin at the country-wise onset of the pandemic. Linear mixed models revealed a significant effect of mandated BCG policies on the growth rate of both cases and deaths after controlling for median age, gross domestic product per capita, population density, population size, net migration rate, and various cultural dimensions (e.g., individualism). Our analysis suggests that mandated BCG vaccination can be effective in the fight against COVID-19.",This research received no specific funding from any funding agency.,Science Advances,,"BCG Vaccine; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Public Health; Vaccination",2020-08,2020,6,32,eabc1463,All OA; Gold,Article,"Berg, Martha K.; Yu, Qinggang; Salvador, Cristina E.; Melani, Irene; Kitayama, Shinobu","Berg, Martha K.

Using Taiwan as an example, this report describes the sources of potential medication shortages, discusses the preparedness and contingency strategies to address medication shortages, and outlines the evidence-based recommendations on ensuring a stable medication supply and improving the quality and security of medicines. Many drug shortages have focused on shortfalls of overseas manufacturing, but the effect of the COVID-19 crisis on misallocation of medications within the nation's internal supply chains is also a great concern. A wide range of stakeholders are involved in pharmaceutical supply chains, including government regulators, health care insurers, pharmaceutical companies, frontline physicians and pharmacists, patients and families, professional and patient associations or unions, and even individuals who acquire medications from abroad. Collaborative inputs and efforts from all these interdependent stakeholders are critical for establishing transparent preparedness and contingency plans to address drug shortages affected by disruptions of overseas manufacturing or stockouts in pharmacies owing to medication misallocation. Strategies have been documented and recommended in Taiwan and the United States to mitigate drug shortages and ensure the long-term quality and security of medicines. Barriers to accessing medicines are nothing new, but the COVID-19 pandemic poses urgent and even novel challenges to the stability and integrity of medication supply, which urges for a need to reconsider and reinforce effective management strategies for pharmaceuticals. Active management, transparent information, and timely communications are essential to ensure a stable supply of key therapeutic medications, especially during a pandemic.",,Journal of the American Pharmacists Association,,,2020-08,2020,,,,All OA; Gold,Article,"Kuo, Shihchen; Ou, Huang-Tz; Wang, C.

Examining patterns that emerged as the pandemic unfolded in Metropolitan Detroit, with disproportionate impacts on African American and low-income communities, we consider conditions that contributed to excess exposure, mortality, and reduced access to critical health protective resources. Using a life course framework, we consider enduring impacts of the pandemic for health equity. Finally, we suggest several strategic actions in three focal areas-environment, occupation, and housing-that can be taken by health educators working in partnership with community members, researchers, and decision makers, using, for example, a community-based participatory research approach, to reduce adverse impacts of COVID-19 and promote long-term equity in health.","We thank Community Action to Promote Healthy Environments, established in 2014 (http://caphedetroit.sph.umich.edu/about-us/); the Detroit Community-Academic Urban Research Center (Detroit URC), established in 1995 (https://www.detroiturc.org/); the Healthy Environments Partnership, established in 2000 (https://www.hepdetroit.org/); and the members of the M-LEEaD Center Stakeholder Advocacy Board, established in 2014 (http://mleead.umich.edu/Coec_Stakeholder_Advocacy_Board.php), for insights, inspiration, and contributions to the recommendations reflected in this article.

Cherian and co-workers take issue with our interpretation of the respiratory physiology of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), arguing that it is based merely on “small cohort studies”, and instead declaring that “a high proportion of mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients exhibit near-normal lung compliance”. Yet the low respiratory compliance of COVID-19 patients has now been extensively demonstrated by studies totalling more than 800 COVID-19 patients [1–7], including a direct comparison with non-COVID-19 acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) patients that revealed no difference in respiratory compliance [7]. In contrast, the three case series cited by R. Cherian and co-workers in support of their claim comprise cohorts of, respectively, 16, 10 and 26 patients [8–10]. Furthermore, even these case series report average respiratory compliance in COVID-19 of 40–45 mL·cmH2O−1, which is in fact abnormal and far from “near-normal compliance” [11, 12].

Efforts to mitigate the spread of the virus through social distancing and shelter-at-home edicts have unintended consequences upon clinical and educational missions and mental well-being of radiology departments. We sought to understand the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on radiology residencies with respect to the educational mission and perceptions of impact on well-being. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was IRB exempt. An anonymous 22 question survey regarding the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on educational and clinical missions of residencies, its perceived impact upon morale of radiologists and trainees and a query of innovative solutions devised in response, was emailed to the Association of Program Directors in Radiology membership. Survey data were collected using SurveyMonkey (San Mateo, California). RESULTS: Respondents felt the COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted their residency programs. Regarding the educational mission impact, 70.1% (75/107) report moderate/marked negative impact and 2.8% (3/107) that educational activities have ceased. Regarding the pandemic's impact on resident morale, 44.8% (48/107) perceive moderate/marked negative effect; perceived resident morale in programs with redeployment is significantly worse with 57.1% (12/21) reporting moderate/marked decrease. Respondents overwhelmingly report adequate resident access to mental health resources during the acute phase of the pandemic (88.8%, 95/107). Regarding morale of program directors, 61% (65/106) report either mild or marked decreased morale. Program innovations reported by program directors were catalogued and shared.

A systematic review of recent research on the influence of PRR politicians on the health and welfare policies shows that health is not a policy arena that these politicians have much experience in. In office, their effects can be destructive, primarily because they subordinate health to their other goals. Brazil, the US and the UK all show this pattern. PRR politicians in opposition such as the Freedom Party of Austria (FPÖ) in Austria or the Lega in Italy, said very little during the actual health crisis, but once the public no longer appeared afraid they lost no time in reactivating anti-European Union (EU) sentiments.

Limitations in intensive care resources and personal protective equipment have required many practices throughout the globe to pause elective operations and now slowly resume operations. However, much of cardiac surgery is not elective and patients continue to require surgery on an urgent or emergent basis during the pandemic. This continued need for providing surgical services has introduced several unique considerations ranging from how to prioritize surgery, how to ensure safety for cardiac surgical teams, and how best to resume elective operations to ensure the safety of patients. Additionally, the COVID‐19 pandemic has required a careful analysis of how best to carry out heart transplantation, extra‐corporeal membrane oxygenation, and congenital heart surgery. In this review, we present the many areas of multidisciplinary consideration, and the lessons learned that have allowed us to carry out cardiac surgery with excellence during the COVID‐19 pandemic. As various states experience plateaus, declines, and rises in COVID‐19 cases, these considerations are particularly important for cardiac surgical programs throughout the globe.",The authors acknowledge Ms Olivia Kranz for her assistance in coordination of this manuscript and Mrs Prezley Duncan for her assistance in organization of the manuscript for publication as well as graphics.,Journal of Cardiac Surgery,,,2020-08,2020,35,8,1979-1987,All OA; Gold,Article,"Iribarne, Alexander; Thourani, Vinod H.; Cleveland, Joseph C.; Malaisrie, Sukit Christopher; Romano, Matthew A.; Moon, Marc R.; Ramakrishna, Harish; Mewhort, Holly E.

Care has been transformed by the crisis, but enduring lessons have been learned. In this article, we review how COVID-19 will impact cirrhosis care. We describe how this impact unfolds over 3 waves; i) an intense period with prioritized high-acuity care with delayed elective procedures and routine care during physical distancing, ii) a challenging 'return to normal' following the end of physical distancing, with increased emergent decompensations, morbidity, and systems of care overwhelmed by the backlog of deferred care, and iii) a protracted period of suboptimal outcomes characterized by missed diagnoses, progressive disease and loss to follow-up. We outline the concrete steps required to preserve the quality of care provided to patients with cirrhosis. This includes an intensification of the preventative care provided to patients with compensated cirrhosis, proactive chronic disease management, robust telehealth programs, and a reorganization of care delivery to provide a full service of care with flexible clinical staffing. Managing the pandemic of a serious chronic disease in the midst of a global infectious pandemic is challenging.

The term ""Fetal Inflammatory Response Syndrome"" (FIRS) was coined to describe a condition characterized by evidence of a systemic inflammatory response, frequently a result of the activation of the innate limb of the immune response. FIRS can be diagnosed by an increased concentration of umbilical cord plasma or serum acute phase reactants such as C-reactive protein or cytokines (e.g., interleukin-6). Pathologic evidence of a systemic fetal inflammatory response indicates the presence of funisitis or chorionic vasculitis. FIRS was first described in patients at risk for intraamniotic infection who presented preterm labor with intact membranes or preterm prelabor rupture of the membranes. However, FIRS can also be observed in patients with sterile intra-amniotic inflammation, alloimmunization (e.g., Rh disease), and active autoimmune disorders. Neonates born with FIRS have a higher rate of complications, such as early-onset neonatal sepsis, intraventricular hemorrhage, periventricular leukomalacia, and death, than those born without FIRS. Survivors are at risk for long-term sequelae that may include bronchopulmonary dysplasia, neurodevelopmental disorders, such as cerebral palsy, retinopathy of prematurity, and sensorineuronal hearing loss. Experimental FIRS can be induced by intra-amniotic administration of bacteria, microbial products (such as endotoxin), or inflammatory cytokines (such as interleukin-1), and animal models have provided important insights about the mechanisms responsible for multiple organ involvement and dysfunction. A systemic fetal inflammatory response is thought to be adaptive, but, on occasion, may become dysregulated whereby a fetal cytokine storm ensues and can lead to multiple organ dysfunction and even fetal death if delivery does not occur (""rescued by birth""). Thus, the onset of preterm labor in this context can be considered to have survival value. The evidence so far suggests that FIRS may compound the effects of immaturity and neonatal inflammation, thus increasing the risk of neonatal complications and long-term morbidity. Modulation of a dysregulated fetal inflammatory response by the administration of antimicrobial agents, anti-inflammatory agents, or cell-based therapy holds promise to reduce infant morbidity and mortality.","This review was supported, in part, by the Perinatology Research Branch, Division of Obstetrics and Maternal-Fetal Medicine, Division of Intramural Research, Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, National Institutes of Health, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (NICHD/NIH/DHHS); and, in part, with Federal funds from NICHD/NIH/DHHS under Contract No. HHSN275201300006C.

To address these issues and optimize pediatric pulmonary training, a group of faculty from various institutions met in 2019 and proposed specific, long-term solutions to the emerging problems in the field. Input on these ideas was then solicited more broadly from faculty with relevant expertise and from recent trainees. This proposal is a synthesis of these ideas. Pediatric pulmonology was among the first pediatric specialties to be grounded deliberately in science, requiring its fellows to demonstrate expertise in scientific inquiry (1). In the future, we will need more training in science, not less. Specifically, the scope of scientific inquiry will need to be broader. The proposal outlined below is designed to help optimize the practices of current providers and to prepare the next generation to be leaders in pediatric care in the future. We are optimistic that this can be accomplished. Our broad objectives are (a) to meet the pediatric subspecialty workforce demand by increasing interest and participation in pediatric pulmonary training; (b) to modernize training to ensure that future pediatric pulmonologists will be prepared clinically and scientifically for the future of the field; (c) to train pediatric pulmonologists who will add value in the future of pediatric healthcare, complemented by advanced practice providers and artificial intelligence systems that are well-informed to optimize quality healthcare delivery; and (d) to decrease the cost and improve the quality of care provided to children with respiratory diseases.","We are indebted to Ms Kenzie Mahan and Mr Jamie Gaston for editorial assistance.

RECENT FINDINGS: We identified 18 published technology-based studies, 6 of which were efficacy trials and the remaining 12 were either pilot randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-experimental studies. Most (n = 10) interventions were conducted outside the USA, including countries in Sub-Saharan Africa (n = 4), China (n = 3), Latin America (n = 2), and India (n = 1). All efficacy trials showed some evidence of efficacy, although uptake of HIV testing was low among in intervention trials that consisted of a low number of text messages. Most pilot RCTs demonstrated high levels of feasibility and acceptability, as well as some evidence that the intervention participants benefited more than the control group. Many non-randomized trials similarly reported positive appraisal by study participants. Recommendations for future research and practice by the authors of the studies reviewed here are summarized. Technology-assisted HIV testing interventions may be an important strategy to reach national and global targets for HIV status awareness in the general population and for most at-risk groups. Although there appears to be growing evidence of their benefit, questions linger regarding how to leverage existing social media platforms to promote HIV testing, which interventions work for what populations, and best practices for scaling up mHealth and other technology-based interventions.",,Current HIV/AIDS Reports,,,2020-08,2020,17,4,269-280,"All OA; Green, Published",Article,"Horvath, Keith J.; Walker, Teresa; Mireles, Linda; Bauermeister, Jose A.; Hightow-Weidman, Lisa; Stephenson, Rob","Horvath, Keith J.

Activity-dependent transcriptional dynamics in neurons, however, remain incompletely characterized because most previous efforts relied on measurement of steady-state mRNAs. Here, we use nascent RNA sequencing to profile transcriptional dynamics of primary neuron cultures undergoing network activity shifts. We find pervasive transcriptional changes, in which ∼45% of expressed genes respond to network activity shifts. We further link retinoic acid-induced 1 (RAI1), the Smith-Magenis syndrome gene, to the transcriptional program driven by reduced network activity. Remarkable agreement among nascent transcriptomes, dynamic chromatin occupancy of RAI1, and electrophysiological properties of Rai1-deficient neurons demonstrates the essential roles of RAI1 in suppressing synaptic upscaling in the naive network, while promoting upscaling triggered by activity silencing. These results highlight the utility of bona fide transcription profiling to discover mechanisms of activity-dependent chromatin remodeling that underlie normal and pathological synaptic plasticity.","We thank Dr. Saurabh Agarwal for providing technical support for BrU-seq experiments and scripts for mapping and annotating RNA-seq data.

Over the past decades, a great variety of complex systems has been successfully described as networks whose interacting pairs of nodes are connected by links. Yet, in face-to-face human communication, chemical reactions and ecological systems, interactions can occur in groups of three or more nodes and cannot be simply described just in terms of simple dyads. Until recently, little attention has been devoted to the higher-order architecture of real complex systems. However, a mounting body of evidence is showing that taking the higher-order structure of these systems into account can greatly enhance our modeling capacities and help us to understand and predict their emerging dynamical behaviors. Here, we present a complete overview of the emerging field of networks beyond pairwise interactions. We first discuss the methods to represent higher-order interactions and give a unified presentation of the different frameworks used to describe higher-order systems, highlighting the links between the existing concepts and representations. We review both the measures designed to characterize the structure of these systems, and the models proposed in the literature to generate synthetic structures, such as random and growing simplicial complexes, bipartite graphs and hypergraphs. We then introduce and discuss the rapidly growing research on higher-order dynamical systems and on dynamical topology. We focus on novel emergent phenomena characterizing landmark dynamical processes, such as diffusion, spreading, synchronization and games, when extended beyond pairwise interactions. We elucidate the relations between higher-order topology and dynamical properties, and conclude with a summary of empirical applications, providing an outlook on current modeling and conceptual frontiers.","F.B. acknowledges partial support from the ERC Synergy Grant 810115 (DYNASNET).

Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the outer surface protein of the cell membrane that is abundantly distributed in the heart, lungs, and kidneys, and plays an important role in molecular docking of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. In this study, we aimed to analyze the difference in the survival rate according to ACE2 expressions in pan-cancer. Methods: The clinical and genomic data of pan-cancer patients were accessed from The cancer Genome Atlas. To identify the prognostic significance of ACE2, we used Kaplan-Meier with log-rank test, and the Cox proportional hazards regression to analyze prognostic significance. Results: In the Kaplan-Meier curve, clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), uveal melanoma, and prostate adenocarcinoma showed statistically significant. In the Cox regression, thyroid carcinoma and glioblastoma multiforme, and ccRCC showed significant results. Only ccRCC had statistically significant, and high ACE2 expression is related to good prognosis. Conclusions: It is known that ACE inhibitor, a primary antihypertensive agent, increases ACE2 expression. Based on these results, we believe that the ACE inhibitor will be important to increase the lifespan of ccRCC patients. This study is the first research to offer a recommendation on the use of anti-hypertensive drugs to ccRCC patients.",,Research Square,,,2020-07-30,2020,,,,"All OA; Green, Published",Preprint,"Kim, Kihun; Ko, Yeji; Ko, Dai Sik; Kim, Yun Hak","Kim, Kihun (Kosin University Gospel Hospital); Ko, Yeji (University of Michigan); Ko, Dai Sik (Gachon University Gil Medical Center); Kim, Yun Hak (Pusan National University - Yangsan Campus)",,"Kim, Kihun (Kosin University Gospel Hospital); Ko, Yeji (University of Michigan); Ko, Dai Sik (Gachon University Gil Medical Center); Kim, Yun Hak ()",University of Michigan; Gachon University Gil Medical Center; Kosin University Gospel Hospital,grid.214458.e; grid.411653.4; grid.411145.4,United States; South Korea; South Korea,,0,0,,,,https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-49602/v1.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1129772500,11 Medical and Health Sciences; 1112 Oncology and Carcinogenesis,

Despite this pivotal role, the nature of the clinical practice today has largely emerged by default. We review the evolution of clinical practice in primary care from its genesis in small practices with paper charts and telephonic patient communication to managed care, pay-for-performance, and today's era of the electronic medical record, value-based payment, and consumerism. We suggest a necessary ""reset"" of expectations that focuses on today's practice structure and the historic face-to-face patient care expectations.

The briefing demonstrates that polarization, which has been a common feature of Mozambican politics since independence, has become more pernicious at least since 2013. As is the case in other countries, pernicious polarization is contributing to rising authoritarianism in Mozambique.

34,pub.1129717615,10.21203/rs.3.rs-47021/v1,,,Immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 in children of parents with symptomatic COVID-19,"Compared to adults, children with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have mild or asymptomatic infection, but the underlying immunological differences remain unclear. We describe clinical features, virology, longitudinal cellular and cytokine immune profile, SARS-CoV-2-specific serology and salivary antibody responses in a family of two parents with PCR-confirmed symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection and their three children, who were repeatedly SARS-CoV-2 PCR negative. Cellular immune profiles and cytokine responses of all children were similar to their parents at all timepoints. All family members had salivary anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies detected, predominantly IgA, that coincided with symptom resolution in 3 of 4 symptomatic members. Plasma from both parents and one child had IgG antibody detected against the S1 protein and virus neutralising activity ranging from just detectable to robust titers. Using a systems serology approach, we show that all family members demonstrated higher levels of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody features than healthy controls. These data indicate that children can mount an immune response to SARS-CoV-2 without virological evidence of infection. This raises the possibility that despite chronic exposure, immunity in children prevents establishment of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Relying on routine virological and serological testing may therefore not identify exposed children, with implications for epidemiological and clinical studies across the life-span.",,Research Square,,,2020-07-28,2020,,,,"All OA; Green, Published",Preprint,"Tosif, Shidan; Neeland, Melanie; Sutton, Philip; Licciardi, Paul; Sarkar, Sohinee; Selva, Kevin; Do, Lien Anh Ha; Donato, Celeste; Toh, Zheng Quan; Higgins, Rachel; Sandt, Carolien van de; Lemke, Melissa; Lee, Christina; Shoffner, Suzanne; Flanagan, Katie; Arnold, Kelly; Mordant, Francesca; Mulholland, Kim; Bines, Julie; Dohle, Kate; Pellicci, Dan; Curtis, Nigel; McNab, Sarah; Steer, Andrew; Saffery, Richard; Subbarao, Kanta; Chung, Amy; Kedzierska, Katherine; Burgner, David; Crawford, Nigel","Tosif, Shidan (Murdoch Children's Research Institute); Neeland, Melanie (Murdoch Children's Research Institute); Sutton, Philip (Murdoch Childrens Research Institute); Licciardi, Paul (Murdoch Childrens Research Institute); Sarkar, Sohinee (Murdoch Children's Research Institute); Selva, Kevin (University of Melbourne); Do, Lien Anh Ha (Murdoch Childrens Research Institute); Donato, Celeste (Murdoch Children's Research Institute); Toh, Zheng Quan (Murdoch Children's Research Institute); Higgins, Rachel (Murdoch Children's Research Institute); Sandt, Carolien van de (University of Melbourne); Lemke, Melissa (University of Michigan–Ann Arbor); Lee, Christina (University of Michigan–Ann Arbor); Shoffner, Suzanne (University of Michigan–Ann Arbor); Flanagan, Katie (Monash University); Arnold, Kelly (University of Michigan–Ann Arbor); Mordant, Francesca (University of Melbourne); Mulholland, Kim (Murdoch Childrens Research Institute); Bines, Julie (Murdoch Children's Research Institute); Dohle, Kate (Murdoch Children's Research Institute); Pellicci, Dan (Murdoch Childrens Research Institute); Curtis, Nigel (The University of Melbourne / The Royal Children's Hospital Melbourne / The Murdoch Children's Research Institute); McNab, Sarah (Royal Children's Hospital); Steer, Andrew (Murdoch Children's Research Institute); Saffery, Richard (Murdoch Childrens Research Institute); Subbarao, Kanta (WHO Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Influenza); Chung, Amy (University of Melbourne); Kedzierska, Katherine (University of Melbourne); Burgner, David (Murdoch Children's Research Institute); Crawford, Nigel (Murdoch Children's Research Institute)",,"Tosif, Shidan (Murdoch Children's Research Institute); Neeland, Melanie (Murdoch Children's Research Institute); Sutton, Philip (Murdoch Children's Research Institute); Licciardi, Paul (Murdoch Children's Research Institute); Sarkar, Sohinee (Murdoch Children's Research Institute); Selva, Kevin (University of Melbourne); Do, Lien Anh Ha (Murdoch Children's Research Institute); Donato, Celeste (Murdoch Children's Research Institute); Toh, Zheng Quan (Murdoch Children's Research Institute); Higgins, Rachel (Murdoch Children's Research Institute); Sandt, Carolien van de (University of Melbourne); Lemke, Melissa (University of Michigan); Lee, Christina (University of Michigan); Shoffner, Suzanne (University of Michigan); Flanagan, Katie (Monash University); Arnold, Kelly (University of Michigan); Mordant, Francesca (University of Melbourne); Mulholland, Kim (Murdoch Children's Research Institute); Bines, Julie (Murdoch Children's Research Institute); Dohle, Kate (Murdoch Children's Research Institute); Pellicci, Dan (Murdoch Children's Research Institute); Curtis, Nigel (University of Melbourne); McNab, Sarah (Royal Children's Hospital); Steer, Andrew (Murdoch Children's Research Institute); Saffery, Richard (Murdoch Children's Research Institute); Subbarao, Kanta (); Chung, Amy (University of Melbourne); Kedzierska, Katherine (University of Melbourne); Burgner, David (Murdoch Children's Research Institute); Crawford, Nigel (Murdoch Children's Research Institute)",Monash University; University of Michigan; Royal Children's Hospital; University of Melbourne; Murdoch Children's Research Institute,grid.1002.3; grid.214458.e; grid.416107.5; grid.1008.9; grid.1058.c,Australia; United States; Australia; Australia; Australia,,0,0,,,17,https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-47021/v1,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1129717615,11 Medical and Health Sciences; 1107 Immunology,

The study describes clusters of COVID-19 cases within Chinese tour groups travelling in Europe January 16-28. We compared characteristics of cases and non-cases to determine transmission dynamics. The index case travelled from Wuhan, China, to Europe on 16 January 2020, and to Shanghai, China, on 27 January 2020, within a tour group (group A). Tour groups with the same outbound flight (group B) or the same tourism venue (group D) and all Chinese passengers on the inbound flight (group C) were investigated. The outbreak involved 11 confirmed cases, 10 suspected cases and six tourists who remained healthy. Group A, involving seven confirmed cases and six suspected cases, consisted of familial transmission followed by propagative transmission. There was less pathogenicity with propagative transmission than with familial transmission. Disease was transmitted in shared outbound flights, shopping venues within Europe and inbound flight back to China. The novel coronavirus caused clustered cases of COVID-19 in tour groups.

The Centers for Disease Control were the sole testing source authorized by the Food and Drug Administration, and when the CDC failed to provide reliable tests in sufficient volume, it took weeks for other providers to be approved and to ramp up testing. Revised policies should decrease the likelihood of sole-sourcing tests in pandemic contexts, which results in a fragile system. The pandemic sole-sourcing failure, however, not only accelerated the pandemic, but also provides lessons for innovation policy about diagnostic testing more generally. Sole-sourcing hurts clinical practice by limiting confirmatory testing and systemic robustness, whether in a pandemic or in regular practice. We thus argue against relying too heavily on exclusivity-creating patents as innovation incentive for diagnostic tests—including the proposed Coons-Tillis patent reform bill which would increase patentability for many such tests. Instead, we propose the use of reformed reimbursement to create better incentives for diagnostic test innovation. In both pandemics and elsewhere, single-sourcing creates too great a point of failure, but targeted innovation policy can help",,Journal of Law and the Biosciences,,,2020-07-25,2020,7,1,lsaa053-,All OA; Gold,Article,"Deb, Chaarushena; Moneer, Osman; Price, W Nicholson","Deb, Chaarushena (Yale Law School, New Haven, Connecticut); Moneer, Osman (Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut); Price, W Nicholson (The University of Michigan Law School, Ann Arbor, Michigan)",,"Deb, Chaarushena (Yale University); Moneer, Osman (Yale University); Price, W Nicholson (University of Michigan)",Yale University; University of Michigan,grid.47100.32; grid.214458.e,United States; United States,Novo Nordisk Foundation,0,0,,,11,https://academic.oup.com/jlb/advance-article-pdf/doi/10.1093/jlb/lsaa053/33471981/lsaa053.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1128996841,18 Law and Legal Studies; 22 Philosophy and Religious Studies; 2201 Applied Ethics; 1801 Law,

PURPOSE: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused health systems across the country to plan for field hospitals to care for patients outside of traditional healthcare settings in the event of a second surge. Here we describe key considerations for the implementation of pharmacy operations and a field hospital formulary at an offsite location within a 2-week time frame. SUMMARY: Development of an offsite field hospital formulary is first dependent on the location and patient population defined for the field hospital. Creation of a limited formulary for a planned field hospital in Michigan involved reviewing physical space limitations and drug distribution workflows, assessing current prescribing trends, creating drug categories, and creating formulary guidelines to limit formulary options in each therapeutic category. Ultimately, our institution developed a 140-medication field hospital formulary, a process to enable appropriate use of nonformulary drugs, and a mixed operations model including automated dispensing cabinets and a manual cart-fill process. Although the institution did not have to open the field hospital, the process used for developing the formulary and determining distribution models will allow for an immediate implementation if a second surge occurs. CONCLUSION: A methodical approach to developing limited formularies and pharmacy operations in a field hospital setting will allow health systems to establish efficient and effective medication distribution services in the event of a second surge of COVID-19 cases.",,American Journal of Health-System Pharmacy,,,2020-07-24,2020,,,zxaa232-,"All OA; Green, Published",Article,"Bazzell, Brian; Wagner, Deb; Durant, Karin M; Callahan, Brian","Bazzell, Brian (Department of Pharmacy Services and Clinical Pharmacy, Michigan Medicine, University of Michigan Health System, Ann Arbor, MI, and University of Michigan College of Pharmacy, Ann Arbor, MI); Wagner, Deb (Department of Pharmacy Services and Clinical Pharmacy, Michigan Medicine, University of Michigan Health System, Ann Arbor, MI, and University of Michigan College of Pharmacy, Ann Arbor, MI); Durant, Karin M (Department of Pharmacy Services and Clinical Pharmacy, Michigan Medicine, University of Michigan Health System, Ann Arbor, MI, and University of Michigan College of Pharmacy, Ann Arbor, MI); Callahan, Brian (Department of Pharmacy Services and Clinical Pharmacy, Michigan Medicine, University of Michigan Health System, Ann Arbor, MI, and University of Michigan College of Pharmacy, Ann Arbor, MI)",,"Bazzell, Brian (Michigan Medicine); Wagner, Deb (Michigan Medicine); Durant, Karin M (Michigan Medicine); Callahan, Brian (Michigan Medicine)",Michigan Medicine,grid.412590.b,United States,,0,0,,,4,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7454278,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1129607328,1117 Public Health and Health Services; 11 Medical and Health Sciences,

In this study, we quantified personalization in mainstream politics by studying the extent to which parliamentary candidates referred to the key leader of their party as opposed to the party itself in their Twitter political campaigns. We found that the candidates of the incumbent right-wing Hindu nationalist party, the BJP, led by a popular and widely approved leader, Narendra Modi, were significantly more likely to run a leader-centric campaign than the candidates of the main opposition party, the INC. Smaller, state and regionalist parties showed mixed results - while candidates of some parties centralized their discourse significantly in their key leaders, in other parties’ campaigns, the party was more prominent than its leader in candidate campaigns. We also found that BJP candidates, rather than uniformly running campaigns coat tailing on their hugely popular leader, were strategic in the extent to which they ran Modi centric campaigns. For BJP candidates, their followers count, the type of constituency and Modi’s own approval rating in the region were closely associated with running Modi-centric campaigns.

The susceptible-infectious-removed (SIR) model and its variants have been used for modeling the pandemic. However, time-independent parameters in the classical models may not capture the dynamic transmission and removal processes, governed by virus containment strategies taken at various phases of the epidemic. Moreover, few models account for possible inaccuracies of the reported cases. We propose a Poisson model with time-dependent transmission and removal rates to account for possible random errors in reporting and estimate a time-dependent disease reproduction number, which may reflect the effectiveness of virus control strategies.

Viral mutations emerge during the virus circulating in the population, which is shaping the viral infectivity and pathogenicity. Here we extensively analyzed 6698 SARS-CoV-2 whole genome sequences with specific sample collection dates in NCBI database. We found that four mutations, i.e., 5’UTR_c-241-t, NSP3_c-3037-t, NSP12_c-14408-t, and S_a-23403-g, became the dominant variants and each of them represented nearly 100% of all virus sequences since the middle May, 2020. Notably, we found that co-occurrence rates of three significant multi-site co-mutational patterns, i.e., (i) S_a-23403-g, NSP12_c-14408-t, 5’UTR_c-241-t, NSP3_c-3037-t, and ORF3a_c-25563-t; (ii) ORF8_t-28144-c, NSP4_c-8782-t, NSP14_c-18060-t, NSP13_a-17858-g, and NSP13_c-17747-t; and (iii) N_g-28881-a, N_g-28882-a, and N_g-28883-c, reached 66%, 90%, and nearly 100% of recent sequences, respectively. Moreover, we found significant decrease of CpG dinucleotide at positions 241(c)-242(g) in the 5’UTR during the evolution, which was verified as a potential target of human zinc finger antiviral protein (ZAP). The four dominant mutations, three significant multi-site co-mutations, and the potential escape mutation of ZAP-target in 5’UTR region contribute to the rapid evolution of SARS-CoV-2 virus in the population, thus shaping the viral infectivity and pathogenicity. This study provides valuable clues and frameworks to dissect the viral replication and virus-host interactions for designing effective therapeutics.

Telemedicine offers opportunities in a variety of specialties that can augment student education during this time. The projected growth of telemedicine necessitates that students learn new skills to be effective providers. In this viewpoint, we delineate specific telehealth opportunities that teach core competencies for patient care, while also teaching telemedicine-specific skills. Schools can further augment student education through a variety of telemedicine initiatives across multiple medical fields. The explosion of telemedicine programs due to the pandemic can be a catalyst for schools to integrate telemedicine into their current curricula. The depth and variety of telemedicine opportunities allow schools to continue providing high-quality medical education while maintaining social distancing policies.",,Journal of Medical Internet Research,,"Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Curriculum; Education, Medical; Humans; Learning; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Students, Medical; Telemedicine",2020-07-20,2020,22,7,e19667,All OA; Gold,Article,"Iancu, Ariella Magen; Kemp, Michael Thomas; Alam, Hasan Badre","Iancu, Ariella Magen (University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI, United States.); Kemp, Michael Thomas (Department of Surgery, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, United States.); Alam, Hasan Badre (Department of Surgery, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, United States.)",,"Iancu, Ariella Magen (University of Michigan); Kemp, Michael Thomas (University of Michigan); Alam, Hasan Badre (University of Michigan)",University of Michigan,grid.214458.e,United States,,3,3,,,4,https://www.aamc.org/system/files/2020-03/Interim%20Guidance%20on%20medical%20students%20voluntary%20participation%203.23%20Final.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1128930061,08 Information and Computing Sciences; 17 Psychology and Cognitive Sciences; 11 Medical and Health Sciences,

Introduction: The purpose of this study was to determine clinician confidence in telemedicine-based eye care services during COVID-19. Materials and Methods: An electronic survey was sent to clinicians at University of Michigan Kellogg Eye Center (April 17, 2020-May 6, 2020) when nonemergent in-person visits and procedures were restricted. The primary outcome was clinician confidence in using telemedicine-based eye care during COVID-19. Secondary outcomes included telemedicine utilization and its association with clinician confidence using Fisher's exact test. Results: Of the 88 respondents (90.7% response rate; n = 97 total), 83.0% (n = 73) were ophthalmologists and 17.0% (n = 15) were optometrists. Telemedicine utilization increased from 30.7% (n = 27) before the pandemic to 86.2% (n = 75) after the pandemic. Clinicians' confidence in their ability to use telemedicine varied with 28.6% (24/84) feeling confident/extremely confident, 38.1% (32/84) somewhat confident, and 33.3% (28/84) not-at-all confident. Most felt that telemedicine was underutilized (62.1%; 54/87) and planned continued use over the next year (59.8%; 52/87). Confident respondents were more likely to have performed three or more telemedicine visits (p = 0.003), to believe telemedicine was underutilized (p < 0.001), and to anticipate continued use of telemedicine (p = 0.009). Discussion: The majority of clinicians were at least somewhat confident about using telemedicine during the pandemic. Clinician confidence was associated with telemedicine visit volume and intention to continue using telemedicine. Conclusions: Policies that foster clinician confidence will be important to sustain telemedicine-based eye care delivery.",,Telemedicine Journal and e-Health,,,2020-07-17,2020,,,,All OA; Gold,Article,"De Lott, Lindsey B.; Newman-Casey, Paula Anne; Lee, Paul P.; Ballouz, Dena; Azzouz, Lyna; Cho, Juno; Valicevic, Autumn N.; Woodward, Maria A.","De Lott, Lindsey B.

There are no antiviral drugs with proven clinical efficacy for the treatment of COVID-19, nor are there any vaccines that prevent infection with SARS-CoV-2, and efforts to develop drugs and vaccines are hampered by the limited knowledge of the molecular details of how SARS-CoV-2 infects cells. Here we cloned, tagged and expressed 26 of the 29 SARS-CoV-2 proteins in human cells and identified the human proteins that physically associated with each of the SARS-CoV-2 proteins using affinity-purification mass spectrometry, identifying 332 high-confidence protein-protein interactions between SARS-CoV-2 and human proteins. Among these, we identify 66 druggable human proteins or host factors targeted by 69 compounds (of which, 29 drugs are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, 12 are in clinical trials and 28 are preclinical compounds). We screened a subset of these in multiple viral assays and found two sets of pharmacological agents that displayed antiviral activity: inhibitors of mRNA translation and predicted regulators of the sigma-1 and sigma-2 receptors. Further studies of these host-factor-targeting agents, including their combination with drugs that directly target viral enzymes, could lead to a therapeutic regimen to treat COVID-19.","We thank J.

The current COVID-19 pandemic, resulting from SARS-CoV-2, induces acute pneumonia, a phenotype that is alarmingly increased with aging. In this article, we review findings of how aging alters immunity to respiratory viral infections to identify age-impacted pathways common to several viral pathogens, permitting us to speculate about potential mechanisms of age-enhanced mortality to COVID-19. Aging generally leads to exaggerated innate immunity, particularly in the form of elevated neutrophil accumulation across murine and large animal studies of influenza infection. COVID-19 patients who succumb exhibit a 2-fold increase in neutrophilia, suggesting that exaggerated innate immunity contributes to age-enhanced mortality to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Further investigation in relevant experimental models will elucidate the mechanisms by which aging impacts respiratory viral infections, including SARS-CoV-2. Such investigation could identify therapies to reduce the suffering of the population at large, but especially among older people, infected with respiratory viruses.",,The Journal of Immunology,,"Aging; Betacoronavirus; Cardiovascular Diseases; Coronavirus Infections; Cytokines; Humans; Influenza, Human; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Respiratory Tract Infections; SARS Virus",2020-07-15,2020,205,2,ji2000380,All OA; Gold,Article,"Chen, Judy; Kelley, William J; Goldstein, Daniel R","Chen, Judy (Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109.; Program in Immunology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109; and.); Kelley, William J (Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109.); Goldstein, Daniel R (Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109; drgoldst@umich.edu.; Program in Immunology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109; and.; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109.)",,"Chen, Judy (University of Michigan; University of Michigan); Kelley, William J (University of Michigan); Goldstein, Daniel R (University of Michigan; University of Michigan; University of Michigan)",University of Michigan,grid.214458.e,United States,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases; National Heart Lung and Blood Institute; National Institute on Aging,9,9,,,50,https://www.jimmunol.org/content/jimmunol/205/2/313.full.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1128189119,11 Medical and Health Sciences; 1107 Immunology,

However, recent published literature places too little emphasis on the economy and economic environments and instead focuses on explanations rooted within individuals and families. In this article, we review research on families' financial stress and well-being published in JFEI between 2010 and 2019, which analyzed data collected during the Great Recession and were subsequently published in the shadow of the economic downturn.

Furthermore, data are conflicting regarding whether COVID-19 severity correlates with degree of olfactory dysfunction. This prospective case-control study analyzed prevalence and severity of subjective loss of smell in outpatients (n = 23) and inpatients (n = 20) with confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection vs healthy controls (n = 25). Olfactory dysfunction was reported more commonly in COVID-19 patients than in healthy controls (P < .001), and outpatients paradoxically reported loss of smell more commonly than inpatients (P = .02). Headaches were present in 52% of patients with olfactory dysfunction. Anosmia or hyposmia persisted beyond 5 days but most of the patients recovered by 30 days, suggesting favorable prognosis for olfaction. Differences between inpatients and outpatients are potentially reflective of timeline of olfactory symptoms and contextual factors, underscoring the importance of corroborative objective testing, coupled with careful tracking of temporal relationships.",,Otolaryngology,,,2020-07-14,2020,,,194599820943530,All OA; Gold,Article,"D'Ascanio, Luca; Pandolfini, Manlio; Cingolani, Cristina; Latini, Gino; Gradoni, Paolo; Capalbo, Maria; Frausini, Gabriele; Maranzano, Massimo; Brenner, Michael J; Di Stadio, Arianna","D'Ascanio, Luca (Department of Head and Neck Surgery, Institute of Otorhinolaryngology, Santa Croce Hospital AORMN, Fano-Pesaro, Italy.); Pandolfini, Manlio (Department of Head and Neck Surgery, Institute of Otorhinolaryngology, Santa Croce Hospital AORMN, Fano-Pesaro, Italy.); Cingolani, Cristina (Department of Head and Neck Surgery, Institute of Otorhinolaryngology, Santa Croce Hospital AORMN, Fano-Pesaro, Italy.); Latini, Gino (Department of Head and Neck Surgery, Institute of Otorhinolaryngology, Santa Croce Hospital AORMN, Fano-Pesaro, Italy.); Gradoni, Paolo (Department of Head and Neck Surgery, Institute of Otorhinolaryngology, Santa Croce Hospital AORMN, Fano-Pesaro, Italy.); Capalbo, Maria (AORMN, Pesaro, Italy.); Frausini, Gabriele (Internal Medicine Department ""Santa Croce Hospital"" AORMN, Fano, Italy.); Maranzano, Massimo (Division of Oral and Maxillofacial and Facial Plastic Surgery, Manchester University Foundation Trust, Manchester, UK.); Brenner, Michael J (Department of Otolaryngology-Head & Neck Surgery, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.); Di Stadio, Arianna (Arianna Di Stadio, Department of Otolaryngology-Head & Neck Surgery, University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy.)",,"D'Ascanio, Luca (); Pandolfini, Manlio (); Cingolani, Cristina (); Latini, Gino (); Gradoni, Paolo (); Capalbo, Maria (); Frausini, Gabriele (); Maranzano, Massimo (); Brenner, Michael J (University of Michigan); Di Stadio, Arianna (University of Perugia)",University of Perugia; University of Michigan,grid.9027.c; grid.214458.e,Italy; United States,,2,2,,,,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0194599820943530,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1129330268,11 Medical and Health Sciences; 1103 Clinical Sciences,

This study was conducted to assess the acceptance of a 50 or 95% effective COVID-19 vaccine, when it becomes available in southeast Asia, among the general population in Indonesia. Methods: A cross-sectional online survey was conducted between March 25 and April 6, 2020. Participants were asked if they would accept a free vaccine which was 95 or 50% effective. Using a logistic regression model, we assessed the associations between sociodemographic characteristics, exposure to COVID-19 information, or perceived risk of infection with acceptance of a hypothetical COVID-19 vaccine. Results: Among 1,359 respondents, 93.3% of respondents (1,268/1,359) would like to be vaccinated for a 95% effective vaccine, but this acceptance decreased to 67.0% (911/1,359) for a vaccine with 50% effectiveness. For a 95% effective vaccine, being a healthcare worker and having a higher perceived risk of COVID-19 infection were associated with higher acceptance, adjusted odds ratio (aOR): 2.01; 95%CI: 1.01, 4.00 and aOR: 2.21; 95%CI: 1.07, 4.59, respectively; compared to civil servants, being retired was associated with less acceptance (aOR: 0.15; 95%CI: 0.04, 0.63). For a 50% effective vaccine, being a healthcare worker was also associated with greater acceptance, aOR: 1.57; 95%CI: 1.12, 2.20. Conclusion: Acceptance of a COVID-19 vaccine was highly influenced by the baseline effectiveness of the vaccine. Preparing the general population to accept a vaccine with relatively low effectiveness may be difficult.",We would like to thank Dr. Zinatul Hayati who facilitated the ethical application for the study.,Frontiers in Public Health,,,2020-07-14,2020,8,,381,All OA; Gold,Article,"Harapan, Harapan; Wagner, Abram L.; Yufika, Amanda; Winardi, Wira; Anwar, Samsul; Gan, Alex Kurniawan; Setiawan, Abdul Malik; Rajamoorthy, Yogambigai; Sofyan, Hizir; Mudatsir, Mudatsir","Harapan, Harapan (Medical Research Unit, School of Medicine, Universitas Syiah Kuala, Banda Aceh, Indonesia; Tropical Disease Centre, School of Medicine, Universitas Syiah Kuala, Banda Aceh, Indonesia; Department of Microbiology, School of Medicine, Universitas Syiah Kuala, Banda Aceh, Indonesia); Wagner, Abram L.

Health professionals involved in dysphagia care are impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic in their day-to-day practices. Otolaryngologists, gastroenterologists, rehabilitation specialists, and speech-language pathologists are subject to virus exposure due to their proximity to the aerodigestive tract and reliance on aerosol-generating procedures in swallow assessments and interventions. Across the globe, professional societies and specialty associations are issuing recommendations about which procedures to use, when to use them, and how to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission during their use. Balancing safety for self, patients, and the public while maintaining adequate evidence-based dysphagia practices has become a significant challenge. This paper provides current evidence on COVID-19 transmission during commonly used dysphagia practices and provides recommendations for protection while conducting these procedures. The paper summarizes current understanding of dysphagia in patients with COVID-19 and draws on evidence for dysphagia interventions that can be provided without in-person consults and close proximity procedures including dysphagia screening and telehealth.","The Dysphagia Research Society COVID-19 Taskforce is a multidisciplinary group of academic and healthcare professionals with expertise in Speech-Language Pathology, Otolaryngology, Gastroenterology, Critical/Intensive Care, Emergency Medicine, Infectious Diseases and Respiratory Care. Our understanding and response to COVID-19 is rapidly changing, and is country-specific depending on the local spread of COVID-19. Guidance will change over time and is dependent on new scientific evidence. This manuscript describes the current situation at the time of submission, and up-to-date information will need to be compiled as circumstances change.

The primary endpoint was survival probability post-intubation; secondary analyses included an ordinal illness severity scale integrating superinfections. Outcomes in patients who received tocilizumab compared to tocilizumab-untreated controls were evaluated using multivariable Cox regression with propensity score inverse probability weighting (IPTW). RESULTS: 154 patients were included, of whom 78 received tocilizumab and 76 did not. Median follow-up was 47 days (range 28-67). Baseline characteristics were similar between groups, although tocilizumab-treated patients were younger (mean 55 vs. 60 years), less likely to have chronic pulmonary disease (10% vs. 28%), and had lower D-dimer values at time of intubation (median 2.4 vs. 6.5 mg/dL). In IPTW-adjusted models, tocilizumab was associated with a 45% reduction in hazard of death [hazard ratio 0.55 (95% CI 0.33, 0.90)] and improved status on the ordinal outcome scale [odds ratio per 1-level increase: 0.58 (0.36, 0.94)]. Though tocilizumab was associated with an increased proportion of patients with superinfections (54% vs. 26%; p<0.001), there was no difference in 28-day case fatality rate among tocilizumab-treated patients with versus without superinfection [22% vs. 15%; p=0.42]. Staphylococcus aureus accounted for ~50% of bacterial pneumonia. CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort of mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients, tocilizumab was associated with lower mortality despite higher superinfection occurrence.",,Clinical Infectious Diseases,,,2020-07-11,2020,,,ciaa954-,All OA; Gold,Article,"Somers, Emily C; Eschenauer, Gregory A; Troost, Jonathan P; Golob, Jonathan L; Gandhi, Tejal N; Wang, Lu; Zhou, Nina; Petty, Lindsay A; Baang, Ji Hoon; Dillman, Nicholas O; Frame, David; Gregg, Kevin S; Kaul, Dan R; Nagel, Jerod; Patel, Twisha S; Zhou, Shiwei; Lauring, Adam S; Hanauer, David A; Martin, Emily; Sharma, Pratima; Fung, Christopher M; Pogue, Jason M","Somers, Emily C (University of Michigan, Department of Internal Medicine, Ann Arbor, MI USA; University of Michigan, Department of Environmental Health Sciences, Ann Arbor, MI USA; University of Michigan, Department of Obstetrics & Gynecology, Ann Arbor, MI USA); Eschenauer, Gregory A (University of Michigan, Department of Clinical Pharmacy, College of Pharmacy, Ann Arbor, MI USA); Troost, Jonathan P (University of Michigan, Michigan Institute for Clinical & Health Research, Ann Arbor, MI USA); Golob, Jonathan L (University of Michigan, Department of Internal Medicine, Ann Arbor, MI USA); Gandhi, Tejal N (University of Michigan, Department of Internal Medicine, Ann Arbor, MI USA); Wang, Lu (University of Michigan, Department of Biostatistics, Ann Arbor, MI USA); Zhou, Nina (University of Michigan, Department of Biostatistics, Ann Arbor, MI USA); Petty, Lindsay A (University of Michigan, Department of Internal Medicine, Ann Arbor, MI USA); Baang, Ji Hoon (University of Michigan, Department of Internal Medicine, Ann Arbor, MI USA); Dillman, Nicholas O (University of Michigan, Department of Pharmacy, Michigan Medicine, Ann Arbor, MI USA); Frame, David (University of Michigan, Department of Clinical Pharmacy, College of Pharmacy, Ann Arbor, MI USA); Gregg, Kevin S (University of Michigan, Department of Internal Medicine, Ann Arbor, MI USA); Kaul, Dan R (University of Michigan, Department of Internal Medicine, Ann Arbor, MI USA); Nagel, Jerod (University of Michigan, Department of Pharmacy, Michigan Medicine, Ann Arbor, MI USA); Patel, Twisha S (University of Michigan, Department of Pharmacy, Michigan Medicine, Ann Arbor, MI USA); Zhou, Shiwei (University of Michigan, Department of Internal Medicine, Ann Arbor, MI USA); Lauring, Adam S (University of Michigan, Department of Internal Medicine, Ann Arbor, MI USA); Hanauer, David A (University of Michigan, Department of Learning Health Sciences, Ann Arbor, MI USA); Martin, Emily (University of Michigan, Department of Epidemiology, Ann Arbor, MI USA); Sharma, Pratima (University of Michigan, Department of Internal Medicine, Ann Arbor, MI USA); Fung, Christopher M (University of Michigan, Department of Emergency Medicine, Ann Arbor, MI USA); Pogue, Jason M (University of Michigan, Department of Clinical Pharmacy, College of Pharmacy, Ann Arbor, MI USA)",,"Somers, Emily C (University of Michigan; University of Michigan; University of Michigan); Eschenauer, Gregory A (University of Michigan); Troost, Jonathan P (University of Michigan); Golob, Jonathan L (University of Michigan); Gandhi, Tejal N (University of Michigan); Wang, Lu (University of Michigan); Zhou, Nina (University of Michigan); Petty, Lindsay A (University of Michigan); Baang, Ji Hoon (University of Michigan); Dillman, Nicholas O (); Frame, David (University of Michigan); Gregg, Kevin S (University of Michigan); Kaul, Dan R (University of Michigan); Nagel, Jerod (); Patel, Twisha S (); Zhou, Shiwei (University of Michigan); Lauring, Adam S (University of Michigan); Hanauer, David A (University of Michigan); Martin, Emily (University of Michigan); Sharma, Pratima (University of Michigan); Fung, Christopher M (University of Michigan); Pogue, Jason M (University of Michigan)",University of Michigan,grid.214458.e,United States,National Heart Lung and Blood Institute; American Society of Transplantation; National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,58,58,,,475,https://academic.oup.com/cid/advance-article-pdf/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa954/33486716/ciaa954.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1129157382,11 Medical and Health Sciences; 1103 Clinical Sciences,

We conducted a cross-sectional survey with a global sample of gay men and other MSM (n = 2732) from April 16, 2020 to May 4, 2020, through a social networking app. We characterized the economic, mental health, HIV prevention and HIV treatment impacts of COVID-19 and the COVID-19 response, and examined whether sub-groups of our study population are disproportionately impacted by COVID-19. Many gay men and other MSM not only reported economic and mental health consequences, but also interruptions to HIV prevention and testing, and HIV care and treatment services. These consequences were significantly greater among people living with HIV, racial/ethnic minorities, immigrants, sex workers, and socio-economically disadvantaged groups. These findings highlight the urgent need to mitigate the negative impacts of COVID-19 among gay men and other MSM.","We would like to acknowledge the following language translators: Ana Cara-Linda, Angelica Lopez, Anna Yakusik, Carol Strong, Damiano Cerasuolo, Edward Sutanto, Ezgi Ayeser, Henrique Vicentim, Howie Lim, Jose Garcia, Junming Wu, Ketty Rosenfeld, Luana Araujo, Mariano Ruiz, Maryam Motaghi, Omar Cherakoui, Panyaphon Phiphatkunarnon, Pedro Moreno, Poyao Huang, Souad Orhan, Stephane Ku, Tanat Chinbunchorn, Teak Sowaprux, Top Medping, Yalda Toofan.

Because of a lack of comprehensive measurement tools, this rapid growth in access to digital media is accompanied by a scarcity of research examining the family media context and sociocognitive outcomes. There is also little cross-cultural research in families with young children. Modern media are mobile, interactive, and often short in duration, making them difficult to remember when caregivers respond to surveys about media use. The Comprehensive Assessment of Family Media Exposure (CAFE) Consortium has developed a novel tool to measure household media use through a web-based questionnaire, time-use diary, and passive-sensing app installed on family mobile devices. The goal of developing a comprehensive assessment of family media exposure was to take into account the contextual factors of media use and improve upon the limitations of existing self-report measures, while creating a consistent, scalable, and cost-effective tool. The CAFE tool captures the content and context of early media exposure and addresses the limitations of prior media measurement approaches. Preliminary data collected using this measure have been integrated into a shared visualization platform. In this perspective article, we take a tools-of-the-trade approach (Oakes, 2010) to describe four challenges associated with measuring household media exposure in families with young children: measuring attitudes and practices; capturing content and context; measuring short bursts of mobile device usage; and integrating data to capture the complexity of household media usage. We illustrate how each of these challenges can be addressed with preliminary data collected with the CAFE tool and visualized on our dashboard. We conclude with future directions including plans to test reliability, validity, and generalizability of these measures.",,Frontiers in Psychology,,,2020-07-10,2020,11,,1283,All OA; Gold,Article,"Barr, Rachel; Kirkorian, Heather; Radesky, Jenny; Coyne, Sarah; Nichols, Deborah; Blanchfield, Olivia; Rusnak, Sylvia; Stockdale, Laura; Ribner, Andy; Durnez, Joke; Epstein, Mollie; Heimann, Mikael; Koch, Felix-Sebastian; Sundqvist, Annette; Birberg-Thornberg, Ulrika; Konrad, Carolin; Slussareff, Michaela; Bus, Adriana; Bellagamba, Francesca; Fitzpatrick, caroline","Barr, Rachel (Department of Psychology, Georgetown University, Washington, DC, United States); Kirkorian, Heather (Human Development and Family Studies, University of Wisconsin–Madison, Madison, WI, United States); Radesky, Jenny (Department of Pediatrics, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, United States); Coyne, Sarah (School of Family Life, Brigham Young University, Provo, UT, United States); Nichols, Deborah (Department of Human Development and Family Studies, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, United States); Blanchfield, Olivia (Department of Psychology, Georgetown University, Washington, DC, United States); Rusnak, Sylvia (Department of Psychology, Georgetown University, Washington, DC, United States); Stockdale, Laura (School of Family Life, Brigham Young University, Provo, UT, United States); Ribner, Andy (Learning Research and Development Center, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, United States); Durnez, Joke (OpenLattice, Inc., Redwood City, CA, United States); Epstein, Mollie (OpenLattice, Inc., Redwood City, CA, United States); Heimann, Mikael (Division of Psychology, Linköping University, Linköping, Sweden); Koch, Felix-Sebastian (Division of Psychology, Linköping University, Linköping, Sweden); Sundqvist, Annette (Division of Psychology, Linköping University, Linköping, Sweden); Birberg-Thornberg, Ulrika (Division of Psychology, Linköping University, Linköping, Sweden); Konrad, Carolin (Department of Clinical Child and Adolescent Psychology, Ruhr-University Bochum, Bochum, Germany); Slussareff, Michaela (Institute of Information Studies and Librarianship, Charles University, Prague, Czechia; School of Communication and Media, University of New York in Prague, Prague, Czechia); Bus, Adriana (Department of Education, University of Stavanger, Stavanger, Norway); Bellagamba, Francesca (Department of Dynamic and Clinical Psychology, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy); Fitzpatrick, caroline (Department of Dynamic and Clinical Psychology, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy)","Barr, Rachel (Georgetown University)","Barr, Rachel (Georgetown University); Kirkorian, Heather (University of Wisconsin–Madison); Radesky, Jenny (University of Michigan); Coyne, Sarah (Brigham Young University); Nichols, Deborah (Purdue University West Lafayette); Blanchfield, Olivia (Georgetown University); Rusnak, Sylvia (Georgetown University); Stockdale, Laura (Brigham Young University); Ribner, Andy (University of Pittsburgh); Durnez, Joke (); Epstein, Mollie (); Heimann, Mikael (Linköping University); Koch, Felix-Sebastian (Linköping University); Sundqvist, Annette (Linköping University); Birberg-Thornberg, Ulrika (Linköping University); Konrad, Carolin (Ruhr University Bochum); Slussareff, Michaela (Charles University; University of New York in Prague); Bus, Adriana (Stavanger University Hospital); Bellagamba, Francesca (Sapienza University of Rome); Fitzpatrick, caroline (Sapienza University of Rome)",Purdue University West Lafayette; Georgetown University; University of Michigan; Ruhr University Bochum; Charles University; Linköping University; University of Pittsburgh; Stavanger University Hospital; University of Wisconsin–Madison; University of New York in Prague; Brigham Young University; Sapienza University of Rome,grid.169077.e; grid.213910.8; grid.214458.e; grid.5570.7; grid.4491.8; grid.5640.7; grid.21925.3d; grid.412835.9; grid.14003.36; grid.449989.1; grid.253294.b; grid.7841.a,United States; United States; United States; Germany; Czechia; Sweden; United States; Norway; United States; Czechia; United States; Italy,,1,1,,,10,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.01283/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1129133697,1702 Cognitive Sciences; 17 Psychology and Cognitive Sciences; 1701 Psychology,

These heteroge- neous patterns are also observed within individual states, with patches of concentrated outbreaks. Data is being generated daily at all of these spatial scales, and answers to questions regarded re- opening strategies are desperately needed. Mathematical modeling is useful in exactly these cases, and using modeling at a county scale may be valuable to further predict disease dynamics for the purposes of public health interventions. To explore this issue, we study and predict the spread of COVID-19 in Washtenaw County, MI, the home to University of Michigan, Eastern Michigan University, and Google, as well as serving as a sister city to Detroit, MI where there has been a serious outbreak. Here, we apply a discrete and stochastic network-based modeling framework allowing us to track every individual in the county. In this framework, we construct contact net- works based on synthetic population datasets specific for Washtenaw County that are derived from US Census datasets. We assign individuals to households, workplaces, schools, and group quarters (such as prisons). In addition, we assign casual contacts to each individual at random. Using this framework, we explicitly simulate Michigan-specific government-mandated workplace and school closures as well as social distancing measures. We also perform sensitivity analyses to identify key model parameters and mechanisms contributing to the observed disease burden in the three months following the first observed cases on COVID-19 in Michigan. We then consider several scenarios for relaxing restrictions and reopening workplaces to predict what actions would be most prudent. In particular, we consider the effects of 1) different timings for reopening, and 2) different levels of workplace vs. casual contact re-engagement. Through simulations and sensitivity analyses, we explore mechanisms driving magnitude and timing of a second wave of infections upon re-opening. This model can be adapted to other US counties using synthetic population databases and data specific to those regions.",,,,,2020-07-07,2020,,,,"All OA; Green, Published",Article,"Renardy, Marissa; Kirschner, Denise","Renardy, Marissa (University of Michigan Medical School.); Kirschner, Denise (University of Michigan Medical School.)",,"Renardy, Marissa (University of Michigan); Kirschner, Denise (University of Michigan)",University of Michigan,grid.214458.e,United States,National Heart Lung and Blood Institute; National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,1,1,,,2,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2020/07/07/2020.07.06.20147223.full.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1129077508,1117 Public Health and Health Services; 11 Medical and Health Sciences,

However, the effect of plasma therapy in Parkinson's disease (PD) is unknown. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to determine the safety, tolerability, and feasibility of plasma infusions in people with PD. METHODS: A total of 15 people with clinically established PD, at least 1 cognitive complaint, and on stable therapy received 1 unit of young fresh frozen plasma twice a week for 4 weeks. Assessments and adverse effects were performed/reported on and off therapy at baseline, immediately after, and 4 weeks after the infusions ended. Adverse effects were also assessed during infusions. The primary outcomes were safety, tolerability, and feasibility. Exploratory outcomes included Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale Part III off medication, neuropsychological battery, Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire-39, inflammatory markers (tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-6), uric acid, and quantitative kinematics. RESULTS: Adherence rate was 100% with no serious adverse effects. There was evidence of improvement in phonemic fluency (P = 0.002) and in the Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire-39 stigma subscore (P = 0.013) that were maintained at the delayed evaluation. Elevated baseline tumor necrosis factor-α levels decreased 4 weeks after the infusions ended. CONCLUSIONS: Young fresh frozen plasma was safe, feasible, and well tolerated in people with PD, without serious adverse effects and with preliminary evidence for improvements in phonemic fluency and stigma. The results of this study warrant further therapeutic investigations in PD and provide safety and feasibility data for plasma therapy in people with PD who may be at higher risk for severe complications of COVID-19. © 2020 The Authors.

Previous studies on its counterparts prove a complex and concomitant interaction between coronaviruses and autophagy. The precise manipulation of this pathway allows these viruses to exploit the autophagy molecular machinery while avoiding its protective apoptotic drift and cellular innate immune responses. In turn, the maneuverability margins of such hijacking appear to be so narrow that the modulation of the autophagy, regardless of whether using inducers or inhibitors (many of which are FDA-approved for the treatment of other diseases), is usually detrimental to viral replication, including SARS-CoV-2. Recent discoveries indicate that these interactions stretch into the still poorly explored noncanonical autophagy pathway, which might play a substantial role in coronavirus replication. Still, some potential therapeutic targets within this pathway, such as RAB9 and its interacting proteins, look promising considering current knowledge. Thus, the combinatory treatment of COVID-19 with drugs affecting both canonical and noncanonical autophagy pathways may be a turning point in the fight against this and other viral infections, which may also imply beneficial prospects of long-term protection.",We thank Diego Sanz for graphical support.,Cells,,"Antiviral Agents; Apoptosis; Autophagy; Autophagy-Related Proteins; Betacoronavirus; Capsid Proteins; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Virus Replication",2020-07-05,2020,9,7,1619,All OA; Gold,Article,"Bello-Perez, Melissa; Sola, Isabel; Novoa, Beatriz; Klionsky, Daniel J.; Falco, Alberto","Bello-Perez, Melissa (Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, National Center of Biotechnology (CNB-CSIC), Campus Universidad Autónoma de Madrid, Darwin 3, 28049 Madrid, Spain;, mloreto@cnb.csic.es, (M.B.-P.);, isola@cnb.csic.es, (I.S.)); Sola, Isabel (Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, National Center of Biotechnology (CNB-CSIC), Campus Universidad Autónoma de Madrid, Darwin 3, 28049 Madrid, Spain;, mloreto@cnb.csic.es, (M.B.-P.);, isola@cnb.csic.es, (I.S.)); Novoa, Beatriz (Institute of Marine Research (IIM), National Research Council (CSIC), 36208 Vigo, Spain;, beatriznovoa@iim.csic.es); Klionsky, Daniel J.

Our literature and clinical trial survey showed that the whole virus, as well as the spike (S) protein, nucleocapsid (N) protein, and membrane (M) protein, have been tested for vaccine development against SARS and MERS. However, these vaccine candidates might lack the induction of complete protection and have safety concerns. We then applied the Vaxign and the newly developed machine learning-based Vaxign-ML reverse vaccinology tools to predict COVID-19 vaccine candidates. Our Vaxign analysis found that the SARS-CoV-2 N protein sequence is conserved with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV but not from the other four human coronaviruses causing mild symptoms. By investigating the entire proteome of SARS-CoV-2, six proteins, including the S protein and five non-structural proteins (nsp3, 3CL-pro, and nsp8-10), were predicted to be adhesins, which are crucial to the viral adhering and host invasion. The S, nsp3, and nsp8 proteins were also predicted by Vaxign-ML to induce high protective antigenicity. Besides the commonly used S protein, the nsp3 protein has not been tested in any coronavirus vaccine studies and was selected for further investigation. The nsp3 was found to be more conserved among SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV than among 15 coronaviruses infecting human and other animals. The protein was also predicted to contain promiscuous MHC-I and MHC-II T-cell epitopes, and the predicted linear B-cell epitopes were found to be localized on the surface of the protein. Our predicted vaccine targets have the potential for effective and safe COVID-19 vaccine development. We also propose that an ""Sp/Nsp cocktail vaccine"" containing a structural protein(s) (Sp) and a non-structural protein(s) (Nsp) would stimulate effective complementary immune responses.",,Frontiers in Immunology,,"Animals; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Epitopes, B-Lymphocyte; Humans; Immunogenicity, Vaccine; Machine Learning; Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Viral Proteins; Viral Vaccines",2020-07-03,2020,11,,1581,All OA; Gold,Article,"Ong, Edison; Wong, Mei U; Huffman, Anthony; He, Yongqun","Ong, Edison (Department of Computational Medicine and Bioinformatics, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, United States); Wong, Mei U (Unit for Laboratory Animal Medicine, Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, United States); Huffman, Anthony (Department of Computational Medicine and Bioinformatics, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, United States); He, Yongqun (Department of Computational Medicine and Bioinformatics, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, United States; Unit for Laboratory Animal Medicine, Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, United States)","He, Yongqun (University of Michigan; University of Michigan)","Ong, Edison (University of Michigan); Wong, Mei U (University of Michigan); Huffman, Anthony (University of Michigan); He, Yongqun (University of Michigan; University of Michigan)",University of Michigan,grid.214458.e,United States,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,22,,,14,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2020.01581/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1128940796,11 Medical and Health Sciences; 1107 Immunology,3 Good Health and Well Being

Triage guidelines, however, differ on whether limited resources should focus on maximizing lives or life-years. Choosing between these two approaches has implications for neonatology. Neonatal units have ventilators, some adaptable for adults. This raises the question of whether, in crisis conditions, guidelines for treating extremely premature babies should be altered to free-up ventilators. Some adults who need ventilators will have a survival rate higher than some extremely premature babies. But surviving babies will likely live longer, maximizing life-years. Empiric evidence demonstrates that these babies can derive significant survival benefits from ventilation when compared to adults. When ""triaging"" or choosing between patients, justice demands fair guidelines. Premature babies do not deserve special consideration; they deserve equal consideration.

The suspected contribution of thrombotic events to morbidity and mortality in COVID-19 patients has prompted a search for novel potential options for preventing COVID-19-associated thrombotic disease. In this article by the Global COVID-19 Thrombosis Collaborative Group, we describe novel dosing approaches for commonly used antithrombotic agents (especially heparin-based regimens) and the potential use of less widely used antithrombotic drugs in the absence of confirmed thrombosis. Although these therapies may have direct antithrombotic effects, other mechanisms of action, including anti-inflammatory or antiviral effects, have been postulated. Based on survey results from this group of authors, we suggest research priorities for specific agents and subgroups of patients with COVID-19. Further, we review other agents, including immunomodulators, that may have antithrombotic properties. It is our hope that the present document will encourage and stimulate future prospective studies and randomized trials to study the safety, efficacy, and optimal use of these agents for prevention or management of thrombosis in COVID-19.",The authors would like to acknowledge BioRender for providing templates and the platform that were used for creating Fig. 1 .,Thrombosis and Haemostasis,,"Animals;

Hospitals and healthcare providers are preparing for the anticipated surge in critically ill patients, but few are wholly equipped to manage this new disease. The goals of this document are to provide data on what is currently known about COVID-19, and how it may impact hepatologists and liver transplant providers and their patients. Our aim is to provide a template for the development of clinical recommendations and policies to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on liver patients and healthcare providers. APPROACH AND RESULTS: This article discusses what is known about COVID-19 with a focus on its impact on hepatologists, liver transplant providers, patients with liver disease, and liver transplant recipients. We provide clinicians with guidance for how to minimize the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on their patients' care. CONCLUSIONS: The situation is evolving rapidly, and these recommendations will need to evolve as well. As we learn more about how the COVID-19 pandemic impacts the care of patients with liver disease, we will update the online document available at https://www.aasld.org/about-aasld/covid-19-and-liver.","The authors acknowledge the AASLD Governing Board for their contributions to and support of this article: Jorge A.

The requirement for relatively long periods of ventilation in those who survive means that many are considered for tracheostomy to free patients from ventilatory support and maximise scarce resources. COVID-19 provides unique challenges for tracheostomy care: health-care workers need to safely undertake tracheostomy procedures and manage patients afterwards, minimising risks of nosocomial transmission and compromises in the quality of care. Conflicting recommendations exist about case selection, the timing and performance of tracheostomy, and the subsequent management of patients. In response, we convened an international working group of individuals with relevant expertise in tracheostomy. We did a literature and internet search for reports of research pertaining to tracheostomy during the COVID-19 pandemic, supplemented by sources comprising statements and guidance on tracheostomy care. By synthesising early experiences from countries that have managed a surge in patient numbers, emerging virological data, and international, multidisciplinary expert opinion, we aim to provide consensus guidelines and recommendations on the conduct and management of tracheostomy during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Acknowledgments No funding was received for this Health-care Development paper.

Currently, remdesivir is being investigated in ten randomized controlled trials against COVID-19. The dose regimen of remdesivir is an IV loading dose of 200 mg on day 1 followed by daily IV maintenance doses of 100 mg for 5-9 days. Based on our data analysis, however, remdesivir with IV administration alone is unlikely to achieve excellent clinical efficacy. This analysis is based on the following observations: plasma exposures of remdesivir and its active metabolite are unlikely to be correlated with its clinical efficacy; remdesivir and its active metabolites are unlikely to be adequate in the lung to kill the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Even if remdesivir demonstrates benefits in the current randomized controlled trials, its efficacy may be limited. We suggest that a combination of an IV and pulmonary delivery dose regimen should be studied immediately to realize a potentially more effective antiviral therapy against COVID-19.

Severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia frequently causes hypoxaemic respiratory failure, manifesting in the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Recently, authors have proposed distinct clinical phenotypes of COVID-19 pneumonia in several influential, high-profile essays [1–3]. For example, in a recent perspective in this journal [3], the authors speculated that COVID-19 has five phenotypic presentations: three phenotypes based on severity of hypoxaemia and need for supportive care (no hypoxaemia, mild hypoxaemia, and moderate hypoxaemia), and two phenotypes of severely hypoxaemic patients based on additional physiological and clinical features.

Patients with locally advanced NSCLC (LA-NSCLC) may require treatment in locations where resources are limited, and the prevalence of infection is high. Patients with LA-NSCLC frequently present with comorbidities that increase the risk of severe morbidity and mortality from COVID-19. These risks may be further increased by treatments for LA-NSCLC. Although guiding data is scarce, we present an expert thoracic oncology multidisciplinary (radiation oncology, medical oncology, surgical oncology) consensus of alternative strategies for the treatment of LA-NSCLC during a pandemic. The overarching goals of these approaches are the following: (1) reduce the number of visits to a health care facility, (2) reduce the risk of exposure to severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2, (3) attenuate the immunocompromising effects of lung cancer therapies, and (4) provide effective oncologic therapy. Patients with resectable disease can be treated with definitive nonoperative management if surgical resources are limited or the risks of perioperative care are high. Nonoperative options include chemotherapy, chemoimmunotherapy, and radiation therapy with sequential schedules that may or may not affect long-term outcomes in an era in which immunotherapy is available. The order of treatments may be on the basis of patient factors and clinical resources. Whenever radiation therapy is delivered without concurrent chemotherapy, hypofractionated schedules are appropriate. For patients who are confirmed to have COVID-19, usually, cancer therapies may be withheld until symptoms have resolved with negative viral test results. The risk of severe treatment-related morbidity and mortality is increased for patients undergoing treatment for LA-NSCLC during the COVID-19 pandemic. Adapting alternative treatment strategies as quickly as possible may save lives and should be implemented through communication with the multidisciplinary cancer team.",,Journal of Thoracic Oncology,,"Betacoronavirus; Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung; Comorbidity; Coronavirus Infections; Critical Pathways; Humans; Infection Control; Interdisciplinary Communication; Neoplasm Staging; Pandemics; Patient Care Management; Pneumonia, Viral; Risk Assessment; Risk Management",2020-07,2020,15,7,1137-1146,All OA; Gold,Article,"Kumar, Sameera; Chmura, Steven; Robinson, Clifford; Lin, Steven H.; Gadgeel, Shirish M.; Donington, Jessica; Feliciano, Josephine; Stinchcombe, Thomas E.; Werner-Wasik, Maria; Edelman, Martin J.; Moghanaki, Drew","Kumar, Sameera (Department of Radiation Oncology, Fox chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, PA); Chmura, Steven (Department of Radiation and Cellular Oncology, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL); Robinson, Clifford (Department of Radiation Oncology, Washington University, St. Louis, MO); Lin, Steven H.

Given the large number of patients affected, healthcare personnel and facility resources are stretched to the limit; however, the need for urgent and emergent neurosurgical care continues. This article describes best practices when performing neurosurgical procedures on patients with COVID-19 based on multi-institutional experiences. METHODS: We assembled neurosurgical practitioners from 13 different health systems from across the USA, including those in hot spots, to describe their practices in managing neurosurgical emergencies within the COVID-19 environment. RESULTS: Patients presenting with neurosurgical emergencies should be considered as persons under investigation (PUI) and thus maximal personal protective equipment (PPE) should be donned during interaction and transfer. Intubations and extubations should be done with only anesthesia staff donning maximal PPE in a negative pressure environment. Operating room (OR) staff should enter the room once the air has been cleared of particulate matter. Certain OR suites should be designated as covid ORs, thus allowing for all neurosurgical cases on covid/PUI patients to be performed in these rooms, which will require a terminal clean post procedure. Each COVID OR suite should be attached to an anteroom which is a negative pressure room with a HEPA filter, thus allowing for donning and doffing of PPE without risking contamination of clean areas. CONCLUSION: Based on a multi-institutional collaborative effort, we describe best practices when providing neurosurgical treatment for patients with COVID-19 in order to optimize clinical care and minimize the exposure of patients and staff.",,Journal of NeuroInterventional Surgery,,"Betacoronavirus;

Rapid spread of COVID-19 has forced clinicians to care for patients with a highly contagious disease without evidence-based guidelines. Using a virtual modified nominal group technique, the Pediatric Difficult Intubation Collaborative (PeDI-C), which currently includes 35 hospitals from 6 countries, generated consensus guidelines on airway management in pediatric anesthesia based on expert opinion and early data about the disease. PeDI-C identified overarching goals during care, including minimizing aerosolized respiratory secretions, minimizing the number of clinicians in contact with a patient, and recognizing that undiagnosed asymptomatic patients may shed the virus and infect health care workers. Recommendations include administering anxiolytic medications, intravenous anesthetic inductions, tracheal intubation using video laryngoscopes and cuffed tracheal tubes, use of in-line suction catheters, and modifying workflow to recover patients from anesthesia in the operating room. Importantly, PeDI-C recommends that anesthesiologists consider using appropriate personal protective equipment when performing aerosol-generating medical procedures in asymptomatic children, in addition to known or suspected children with COVID-19. Airway procedures should be done in negative pressure rooms when available. Adequate time should be allowed for operating room cleaning and air filtration between surgical cases. Research using rigorous study designs is urgently needed to inform safe practices during the COVID-19 pandemic. Until further information is available, PeDI-C advises that clinicians consider these guidelines to enhance the safety of health care workers during airway management when performing aerosol-generating medical procedures. These guidelines have been endorsed by the Society for Pediatric Anesthesia and the Canadian Pediatric Anesthesia Society.",,Anesthesia & Analgesia,,"Adolescent; Airway Management; Anesthesia; Anesthesiology;

As we scan the horizon, this crisis has the potential to amplify preexisting racial/ethnic disparities for patients with HNC. Potential drivers of disparate HNC survival resulting from the pandemic include (a) differential access to telemedicine, timely diagnosis, and treatment; (b) implicit bias in initiatives to triage, prioritize, and schedule HNC-directed therapy; and (c) the marked changes in employment, health insurance, and dependent care. We present four strategies to mitigate these disparities: (a) collect detailed data on access to care by race/ethnicity, income, education, and community; (b) raise awareness of HNC disparities; (c) engage stakeholders in developing culturally appropriate solutions; and (d) ensure that surgical prioritization protocols minimize risk of racial/ethnic bias. Collectively, these measures address social determinants of health and the moral imperative to provide equitable, high-quality HNC care.","This work was supported by K08CA237858 from the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and DDCF2015209 from the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation to Dr. Graboyes.

Direct echocardiography imaging review has been shown to predict hemodynamic profiles in PH; however, routine use often overemphasizes Doppler-estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASPDE), which lacks discriminatory power among hemodynamically varied PH subgroups. In patients with PH of varying subtypes at a tertiary referral center, reported echocardiographic findings needed for VEST, including left atrial size, E:e' and systolic interventricular septal flattening, were obtained. Receiver operating characteristic analyses assessed the predictive performance of VEST vs. PASPDE in identifying PHPVD, which was later confirmed by right heart catheterization. VEST demonstrated far superior discriminatory power than PASPDE in identifying PHPVD. A positive score was 80.0% sensitive and 75.6% specific for PHPVD with an area under the curve of 0.81. PASPDE exhibited poorer discriminatory power with an area under the curve of 0.56. VEST's strong discriminatory ability remained unchanged when validated in a second cohort from another tertiary center. We demonstrated that this novel VEST using three routine parameters that can be easily extracted from standard echocardiographic reports can successfully capture PH patients with a high likelihood of PHPVD. During the Covid-19 pandemic, when right heart catheterization and timely access to experts at accredited PH centers may have limited widespread availability, this may assist physicians to rapidly and remotely evaluate PH patients to ensure timely and appropriate care.",,Pulmonary Circulation,,,2020-07,2020,10,3,2045894020950225,All OA; Gold,Article,"Vaidya, Anjali; Golbus, Jessica R.; Vedage, Natasha A.; Mazurek, Jeremy; Raza, Farhan; Forfia, Paul R.","Vaidya, Anjali (Department of Medicine, Cardiovascular Division, Pulmonary Hypertension, Right Heart Failure and CTEPH Program, Temple University School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA, USA); Golbus, Jessica R.

OBJECTIVE: To provide a contemporary picture of the risks from delayed treatment for urologic cancers to assist with triage. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: A collaborative review using literature published as of April 2, 2020. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Patients with low-grade non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer are unlikely to suffer from a 3-6-month delay. Patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer are at risk of disease progression, with radical cystectomy delays beyond 12 wk from diagnosis or completion of neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Prioritization of these patients for surgery or management with radiochemotherapy is encouraged. Active surveillance should be used for low-risk prostate cancer (PCa). Treatment of most patients with intermediate- and high-risk PCa can be deferred 3-6 mo without change in outcomes. The same may be true for cancers with the highest risk of progression. With radiotherapy, neoadjuvant androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is the standard of care. For surgery, although the added value of neoadjuvant ADT is questionable, it may be considered if a patient is interested in such an approach. Intervention may be safely deferred for T1/T2 renal masses, while locally advanced renal tumors (≥T3) should be treated expeditiously. Patients with metastatic renal cancer may consider vascular endothelial growth factor targeted therapy over immunotherapy. Risks for delay in the treatment of upper tract urothelial cancer depend on grade and stage. For patients with high-grade disease, delays of 12 wk in nephroureterectomy are not associated with adverse survival outcomes. Expert guidance recommends expedient local treatment of testis cancer. In penile cancer, adverse outcomes have been observed with delays of ≥3 mo before inguinal lymphadenectomy. Limitations include a paucity of data and methodologic variations for many cancers. CONCLUSIONS: Patients and clinicians should consider the oncologic risk of delayed cancer intervention versus the risks of COVID-19 to the patient, treating health care professionals, and the health care system. PATIENT SUMMARY: The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has led to delays in the treatment of patients with urologic malignancies. Based on a review of the literature, patients with high-grade urothelial carcinoma, advanced kidney cancer, testicular cancer, and penile cancer should be prioritized for treatment during these challenging times.",,European Urology,,"Betacoronavirus; Combined Modality Therapy; Coronavirus Infections; Disease Management; Humans; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Risk Factors; Time-to-Treatment; Triage; Urogenital Neoplasms",2020-07,2020,78,1,29-42,"All OA; Green, Published",Article,"Wallis, Christopher J.D.; Novara, Giacomo; Marandino, Laura; Bex, Axel; Kamat, Ashish M.; Karnes, R.

METHODS AND MATERIALS: A panel of international experts from ASTRO, ESTRO, and select Asia-Pacific countries completed a modified rapid Delphi process. Topics and questions were presented to the group, and subsequent questions were developed from iterative feedback. Each survey was open online for 24 hours, and successive rounds started within 24 hours of the previous round. The chosen cutoffs for strong agreement (≥80%) and agreement (≥66%) were extrapolated from the RAND methodology. Two pandemic scenarios, early (risk mitigation) and late (severely reduced radiation therapy resources), were evaluated. The panel developed treatment recommendations for 5 HNC cases. RESULTS: In total, 29 of 31 of those invited (94%) accepted, and after a replacement 30 of 30 completed all 3 surveys (100% response rate). There was agreement or strong agreement across a number of practice areas, including treatment prioritization, whether to delay initiation or interrupt radiation therapy for intercurrent SARS-CoV-2 infection, approaches to treatment (radiation dose-fractionation schedules and use of chemotherapy in each pandemic scenario), management of surgical cases in event of operating room closures, and recommended adjustments to outpatient clinic appointments and supportive care. CONCLUSIONS: This urgent practice recommendation was issued in the knowledge of the very difficult circumstances in which our patients find themselves at present, navigating strained health care systems functioning with limited resources and at heightened risk to their health during the COVID-19 pandemic. The aim of this consensus statement is to ensure high-quality HNC treatments continue, to save lives and for symptomatic benefit.",,International Journal of Radiation Oncology • Biology • Physics,,"Consensus; Coronavirus Infections; Head and Neck Neoplasms; Humans; Medical Oncology; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Practice Guidelines as Topic; Societies, Medical",2020-07,2020,107,4,618-627,All OA; Gold,Article,"Thomson, David J.; Palma, David; Guckenberger, Matthias; Balermpas, Panagiotis; Beitler, Jonathan J.; Blanchard, Pierre; Brizel, David; Budach, Wilfred; Caudell, Jimmy; Corry, June; Corvo, Renzo; Evans, Mererid; Garden, Adam S.; Giralt, Jordi; Gregoire, Vincent; Harari, Paul M.; Harrington, Kevin; Hitchcock, Ying J.; Johansen, Jorgen; Kaanders, Johannes; Koyfman, Shlomo; Langendijk, J.A.; Le, Quynh-Thu; Lee, Nancy; Margalit, Danielle; Mierzwa, Michelle; Porceddu, Sandro; Soong, Yoke Lim; Sun, Ying; Thariat, Juliette; Waldron, John; Yom, Sue S.","Thomson, David J.

While some, but not all, laboratory findings appear similar to sepsis-associated disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC), COVID-19- induced coagulopathy (CIC) appears to be more prothrombotic than hemorrhagic. It has been postulated that CIC may be an uncontrolled immunothrombotic response to COVID-19, and there is growing evidence of venous and arterial thromboembolic events in these critically ill patients. Clinicians around the globe are challenged with rapidly identifying reasonable diagnostic, monitoring and anticoagulant strategies to safely and effectively manage these patients.

The first, an early pandemic scenario of risk mitigation, is characterized by an altered risk-benefit ratio of radiotherapy for lung cancer patients due to their increased susceptibility for severe COVID-19 infection, and minimization of patient travelling and exposure of radiotherapy staff. The second, a later pandemic scenario, is characterized by reduced radiotherapy resources requiring patient triage. Six common lung cancer cases were assessed for both scenarios: peripherally located stage I NSCLC, locally advanced NSCLC, postoperative radiotherapy after resection of pN2 NSCLC, thoracic radiotherapy and prophylactic cranial irradiation for limited stage SCLC and palliative thoracic radiotherapy for stage IV NSCLC. RESULTS: In a risk-mitigation pandemic scenario, efforts should be made not to compromise the prognosis of lung cancer patients by departing from guideline-recommended radiotherapy practice. In that same scenario, postponement or interruption of radiotherapy treatment of COVID-19 positive patients is generally recommended to avoid exposure of cancer patients and staff to an increased risk of COVID-19 infection. In a severe pandemic scenario characterized by reduced resources, if patients must be triaged, important factors for triage include potential for cure, relative benefit of radiation, life expectancy, and performance status. Case-specific consensus recommendations regarding multimodality treatment strategies and fractionation of radiotherapy are provided. CONCLUSION: This joint ESTRO-ASTRO practice recommendation established pragmatic and balanced consensus recommendations in common clinical scenarios of radiotherapy for lung cancer in order to address the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic.",,International Journal of Radiation Oncology • Biology • Physics,,"Consensus; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Lung Neoplasms; Medical Oncology; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Practice Guidelines as Topic; Risk Management; Societies, Medical; Triage",2020-07,2020,107,4,631-640,All OA; Gold,Article,"Guckenberger, Matthias; Belka, Claus; Bezjak, Andrea; Bradley, Jeffrey; Daly, Megan E.; DeRuysscher, Dirk; Dziadziuszko, Rafal; Faivre-Finn, Corinne; Flentje, Michael; Gore, Elizabeth; Higgins, Kristin A.; Iyengar, Puneeth; Kavanagh, Brian D.; Kumar, Sameera; Le Pechoux, Cecile; Lievens, Yolande; Lindberg, Karin; McDonald, Fiona; Ramella, Sara; Rengan, Ramesh; Ricardi, Umberto; Rimner, Andreas; Rodrigues, George B.; Schild, Steven E.; Senan, Suresh; Simone, Charles B.; Slotman, Ben J.; Stuschke, Martin; Videtic, Greg; Widder, Joachim; Yom, Sue S.; Palma, David","Guckenberger, Matthias (Department of Radiation Oncology, University Hospital Zurich, University of Zurich, Switzerland); Belka, Claus (Department of Radiation Oncology, LMU Klinikum, LMU Munich, Germany); Bezjak, Andrea (Department of Radiation Oncology, Princess Margaret Cancer Center, University of Toronto, Canada); Bradley, Jeffrey (Department of Radiation Oncology, Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University, Atlanta, USA); Daly, Megan E.

Foremost of these quandaries is how to delineate and implement crisis standards of care and, specifically, how to consider how health care resources should be distributed in times of shortage. We review basic principles of disaster planning and resource stewardship with ethical relevance for this and future public health crises, explore the role of illness severity scoring systems and their limitations and potential contribution to health disparities, and consider the role for exceptionally resource-intensive interventions. We also review the philosophical and practical underpinnings of crisis standards of care and describe historical approaches to scarce resource allocation to offer analysis and guidance for pediatric clinicians. Particular attention is given to the impact on children of this endeavor. Although few children have required hospitalization for symptomatic infection, children nonetheless have the potential to be profoundly affected by the strain on the health care system imposed by the pandemic and should be considered prospectively in resource allocation frameworks.",,Pediatrics,,"Betacoronavirus; Child; Coronavirus Infections; Delivery of Health Care; Humans; Pandemics; Pediatrics; Pneumonia, Viral; Resource Allocation",2020-07,2020,146,1,e20201243,All OA; Gold,Article,"Laventhal, Naomi; Basak, Ratna; Dell, Mary Lynn; Diekema, Douglas; Elster, Nanette; Geis, Gina; Mercurio, Mark; Opel, Douglas; Shalowitz, David; Statter, Mindy; Macauley, Robert","Laventhal, Naomi (University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI;); Basak, Ratna (Brookdale University Hospital Medical Center, Brooklyn, New York;); Dell, Mary Lynn (The Ohio State University College of Medicine, Columbus, OH;); Diekema, Douglas (University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, WA;); Elster, Nanette (Loyola University Stritch School of Medicine, Chicago, IL;); Geis, Gina (Albany Medical College, Albany, NY;); Mercurio, Mark (Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut;); Opel, Douglas (University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, WA;); Shalowitz, David (Wake Forest School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, NC;); Statter, Mindy (Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY; 10Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, Oregon); Macauley, Robert (Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, Oregon)","Laventhal, Naomi (University of Michigan)","Laventhal, Naomi (University of Michigan); Basak, Ratna (Brookdale University Hospital and Medical Center); Dell, Mary Lynn (The Ohio State University); Diekema, Douglas (University of Washington); Elster, Nanette (Loyola University Chicago); Geis, Gina (Albany Medical College); Mercurio, Mark (Yale University); Opel, Douglas (University of Washington); Shalowitz, David (Wake Forest University); Statter, Mindy (Albert Einstein College of Medicine); Macauley, Robert (Oregon Health & Science University)",Albany Medical College; Wake Forest University; The Ohio State University; Albert Einstein College of Medicine; Loyola University Chicago; Yale University; Oregon Health & Science University; University of Michigan; Brookdale University Hospital and Medical Center; University of Washington,grid.413558.e; grid.241167.7; grid.261331.4; grid.251993.5; grid.164971.c; grid.47100.32; grid.5288.7; grid.214458.e; grid.287625.c; grid.34477.33,United States; United States; United States; United States; United States; United States; United States; United States; United States; United States,,8,8,,,12,https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/pediatrics/146/1/e20201243.full.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1127364772,1117 Public Health and Health Services; 11 Medical and Health Sciences,

While the majority of these measures are proving effective, they have a high social and economic cost, and response strategies are being adjusted. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that communities should have a voice, be informed and engaged, and participate in this transition phase. We propose ten considerations to support this principle: (1) implement a phased approach to a 'new normal'; (2) balance individual rights with the social good; (3) prioritise people at highest risk of negative consequences; (4) provide special support for healthcare workers and care staff; (5) build, strengthen and maintain trust; (6) enlist existing social norms and foster healthy new norms; (7) increase resilience and self-efficacy; (8) use clear and positive language; (9) anticipate and manage misinformation; and (10) engage with media outlets. The transition phase should also be informed by real-time data according to which governmental responses should be updated.","The authors are grateful to M.J. Crockett of Yale University and L.

Prostate cancer is one of the most common cancers radiation oncology departments treat, and efficient resource utilization is essential in the setting of a pandemic. Herein, we aim to establish recommendations and a framework by which to evaluate prostate radiation therapy management decisions. Methods and Materials: Radiation oncologists from the United States and the United Kingdom rapidly conducted a systematic review and agreed upon recommendations to safely manage patients with prostate cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic. A RADS framework was created: remote visits, and avoidance, deferment, and shortening of radiation therapy was applied to determine appropriate approaches. Results: Recommendations were provided by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network risk group regarding clinical node-positive, postprostatectomy, oligometastatic, and low-volume M1 disease. Across all prostate cancer stages, telemedicine consultations and return visits were recommended when resources/staff available. Delays in consultations and return visits of between 1 and 6 months were deemed safe based on stage of disease. Treatment can be avoided or delayed until safe for very low, low, and favorable intermediate-risk disease. Unfavorable intermediate-risk, high-risk, clinical node-positive, recurrence postsurgery, oligometastatic, and low-volume M1 disease can receive neoadjuvant hormone therapy for 4 to 6 months as necessary. Ultrahypofractionation is preferred for localized, oligometastatic, and low-volume M1, and moderate hypofractionation is preferred for postprostatectomy and clinical node positive disease. Salvage is preferred to adjuvant radiation. Conclusions: Resources can be reduced for all identified stages of prostate cancer. The RADS (remote visits, and avoidance, deferment, and shortening of radiation therapy) framework can be applied to other disease sites to help with decision making in a global pandemic.",Acknowledgements: A.

High viral concentrations in the upper aerodigestive tract, the ability of the virus to be transmitted by asymptomatic carriers and through aerosols, and the need for open airway access during laryngotracheal surgery create a high-risk situation for airway surgeons, anesthesiologists, and operating room personnel. While some surgical cases of laryngotracheal stenosis may be deferred, patients with significant airway obstruction or progressing symptoms often require urgent surgical intervention. We present best practices from our institutional experience for surgical management of laryngotracheal stenosis during this pandemic, including preoperative triage, intraoperative airway management, and personal protective measures.",,Otolaryngology,,"Airway Management; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Disease Transmission, Infectious; Humans; Laryngostenosis; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Tracheal Stenosis",2020-07,2020,163,1,78-80,All OA; Gold,Article,"Prince, Andrew D.

Although it is unclear how long the pandemic will last, it may persist for many months. Throughout this time, it will be important to perform safe, comprehensive, and effective care for patients with and patients without COVID-19, recognizing that asymptomatic transmission is common with this disease. Local idiosyncrasies prevent a single prescriptive strategy. However, general considerations can be applied to most practice environments. A comprehensive strategy will include consideration of local COVID-19 statistics; availability of personal protective equipment; local, state, and federal government mandates; institutional regulatory guidance; local safety measures; health care worker availability; patient and health care worker risk factors; factors specific to the indication(s) for radiology care; and examination or procedure acuity. An accurate risk-benefit analysis of postponing versus performing a given routine radiology examination or procedure often is not possible because of many unknown and complex factors. However, this is the overriding principle: If the risk of illness or death to a health care worker or patient from health care-acquired COVID-19 is greater than the risk of illness or death from delaying radiology care, the care should be delayed; however, if the opposite is true, the radiology care should proceed in a timely fashion.",,Journal of the American College of Radiology,,"Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Cross Infection; Humans; Infection Control; Occupational Exposure; Pandemics; Personal Protective Equipment; Pneumonia, Viral; Practice Management, Medical; Radiology; Risk Assessment; United States; Universal Precautions",2020-07,2020,17,7,839-844,All OA; Gold,Article,"Davenport, Matthew S; Bruno, Michael A; Iyer, Ramesh S; Johnson, Amirh M; Herrera, Ramses; Nicola, Gregory N; Ortiz, Daniel; Pedrosa, Ivan; Policeni, Bruno; Recht, Michael P; Willis, Marc; Zuley, Margarita L; Weinstein, Stefanie","Davenport, Matthew S (Departments of Radiology & Urology, Michigan Medicine, Ann Arbor, Michigan.

Consensus statements were developed to guide clinicians managing lung cancer screening programs and patients with lung nodules during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: An expert panel of 24 members, including pulmonologists (n = 17), thoracic radiologists (n = 5), and thoracic surgeons (n = 2), was formed. The panel was provided with an overview of current evidence, summarized by recent guidelines related to lung cancer screening and lung nodule evaluation. The panel was convened by video teleconference to discuss and then vote on statements related to 12 common clinical scenarios. A predefined threshold of 70% of panel members voting agree or strongly agree was used to determine if there was a consensus for each statement. Items that may influence decisions were listed as notes to be considered for each scenario. RESULTS: Twelve statements related to baseline and annual lung cancer screening (n = 2), surveillance of a previously detected lung nodule (n = 5), evaluation of intermediate and high-risk lung nodules (n = 4), and management of clinical stage I non-small-cell lung cancer (n = 1) were developed and modified. All 12 statements were confirmed as consensus statements according to the voting results. The consensus statements provide guidance about situations in which it was believed to be appropriate to delay screening, defer surveillance imaging of lung nodules, and minimize nonurgent interventions during the evaluation of lung nodules and stage I non-small-cell lung cancer. CONCLUSIONS: There was consensus that during the COVID-19 pandemic, it is appropriate to defer enrollment in lung cancer screening and modify the evaluation of lung nodules due to the added risks from potential exposure and the need for resource reallocation. There are multiple local, regional, and patient-related factors that should be considered when applying these statements to individual patient care.",,Journal of the American College of Radiology,,"Betacoronavirus; Consensus; Coronavirus Infections; Diagnostic Imaging; Early Detection of Cancer; Humans; Lung Neoplasms; Multiple Pulmonary Nodules; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Solitary Pulmonary Nodule",2020-07,2020,17,7,845-854,All OA; Gold,Article,"Mazzone, Peter J.; Gould, Michael K.; Arenberg, Douglas A.; Chen, Alexander C.; Choi, Humberto K.; Detterbeck, Frank C.; Farjah, Farhood; Fong, Kwun M.; Iaccarino, Jonathan M.; Janes, Samuel M.; Kanne, Jeffrey P.; Kazerooni, Ella A.; MacMahon, Heber; Naidich, David P.; Powell, Charles A.; Raoof, Suhail; Rivera, M.

Given the rapidity of spread and inadequate time to prepare for record numbers of sick patients, our surgical community faces an unforeseen challenge. SAGES is committed to the protection and care of patients, their surgeons and staff, and all who are served by the medical community at large. This includes physical health, mental health, and well-being of all involved. The fear of the unknown ahead can be paralyzing. International news media have chronicled the unthinkable situations that physicians and other health care providers have been thrust into as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. These situations include making life or death decisions for patients and their families regarding use of limited health care resources. It includes caring for patients with quickly deteriorating conditions and limited treatments available. Until recently, these situations seemed far from home, and now they are in our own hospitals. As the pandemic broadened its reach, the reality that we as surgeons may be joining the front line is real. It may be happening to you now; it may be on the horizon in the coming weeks. In this context, SAGES put together this document addressing concerns on clinician stressors in these times of uncertainty. We chose to focus on the emotional toll of the situation on the clinician, protecting vulnerable persons, reckoning with social isolation, and promoting wellness during this crisis. At the same time, the last part of this document deals with the ""light at the end of the tunnel,"" discussing potential opportunities, lessons learned, and the positives that can come out of this crisis.",,Surgical Endoscopy,,"Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Delivery of Health Care; Fear; Forecasting; Guidelines as Topic; Health Personnel; Health Promotion; Humans; Occupational Stress; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Quarantine; Stress, Psychological; Surgeons; Vulnerable Populations",2020-07,2020,34,7,2856-2862,All OA; Gold,Article,"Dort, Jonathan; Romanelli, John; Choudhury, Nabajit; Flink, Benjamin J.; Lak, Kathleen; Levy, Shauna; Needleman, Bradley J.; Paget, Charles J.; Telem, Dana; Schwarz, Erin; Zhang, Linda P.; Sylla, Patricia; Mellinger, John D.; Matthews, Brent D.; Feldman, Liane; Pryor, Aurora D.; Asbun, Horacio J.","Dort, Jonathan (Inova Fairfax Medical Campus, Falls Church, VA, USA); Romanelli, John (Baystate Health, Springfield, MA, USA); Choudhury, Nabajit (University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, TN, USA); Flink, Benjamin J.

Consensus statements were developed to guide clinicians managing lung cancer screening programs and patients with lung nodules during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: An expert panel of 24 members, including pulmonologists (n = 17), thoracic radiologists (n = 5), and thoracic surgeons (n = 2), was formed. The panel was provided with an overview of current evidence, summarized by recent guidelines related to lung cancer screening and lung nodule evaluation. The panel was convened by video teleconference to discuss and then vote on statements related to 12 common clinical scenarios. A predefined threshold of 70% of panel members voting agree or strongly agree was used to determine if there was a consensus for each statement. Items that may influence decisions were listed as notes to be considered for each scenario. RESULTS: Twelve statements related to baseline and annual lung cancer screening (n = 2), surveillance of a previously detected lung nodule (n = 5), evaluation of intermediate and high-risk lung nodules (n = 4), and management of clinical stage I non-small cell lung cancer (n = 1) were developed and modified. All 12 statements were confirmed as consensus statements according to the voting results. The consensus statements provide guidance about situations in which it was believed to be appropriate to delay screening, defer surveillance imaging of lung nodules, and minimize nonurgent interventions during the evaluation of lung nodules and stage I non-small cell lung cancer. CONCLUSIONS: There was consensus that during the COVID-19 pandemic, it is appropriate to defer enrollment in lung cancer screening and modify the evaluation of lung nodules due to the added risks from potential exposure and the need for resource reallocation. There are multiple local, regional, and patient-related factors that should be considered when applying these statements to individual patient care.",,CHEST Journal,,"Betacoronavirus; Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung; Consensus; Coronavirus Infections; Early Detection of Cancer; Humans; Lung Neoplasms; Multiple Pulmonary Nodules; Neoplasm Staging; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Radiography, Thoracic; Resource Allocation; Risk Assessment",2020-07,2020,158,1,406-415,All OA; Gold,Article,"Mazzone, Peter J.; Gould, Michael K.; Arenberg, Douglas A.; Chen, Alexander C.; Choi, Humberto K.; Detterbeck, Frank C.; Farjah, Farhood; Fong, Kwun M.; Iaccarino, Jonathan M.; Janes, Samuel M.; Kanne, Jeffrey P.; Kazerooni, Ella A.; MacMahon, Heber; Naidich, David P.; Powell, Charles A.; Raoof, Suhail; Rivera, M.

Here we assess its effect on head and neck surgical education. METHODS: Surveys were sent to current accredited program directors and trainees to assess the impact of COVID-19 on the fellow's experience and employment search. Current fellows' operative logs were compared with those of the 2018 to 2019 graduates. RESULTS: Despite reduction in operative volume, 82% of current American Head and Neck Society fellows have reached the number of major surgical operations to support certification. When surveyed, 86% of program directors deemed their fellow ready to enter practice. The majority of fellows felt prepared to practice ablative (96%), and microvascular surgery (73%), and 57% have secured employment to follow graduation. Five (10%) had a pending job position put on hold due to the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, current accredited trainees remain well-positioned to obtain proficiency and enter the work-force.","The authors would like to thank JJ Jackman (American Head &amp; Neck Society) and Drs Jeffrey Liu (Temple University), Cheri‐Ann Nathan (Louisiana State University, Shreveport), Susan McCammon (University of Alabama), Kris Mosier (University of Indiana), Alex Pearson (University of Chicago), and Elcin Zan (NYU Langone Health), for their incredible support and contributions.",Head & Neck,,"Clinical Competence; Communicable Disease Control; Coronavirus Infections; Curriculum; Education, Medical, Graduate; Employment; Fellowships and Scholarships; Female; Head and Neck Neoplasms; Humans; Male; Occupational Health; Otolaryngology; Pandemics; Patient Safety; Pneumonia, Viral; Risk Assessment; Surveys and Questionnaires; United States",2020-07,2020,42,7,1411-1417,Closed,Article,"Givi, Babak; Moore, Michael G.; Bewley, Arnaud F.; Coffey, Charles S.; Cohen, Marc A.; Hessel, Amy C.; Jalisi, Scharukh; Kang, Steven; Newman, Jason G.; Puscas, Liana; Shindo, Maisie; Shuman, Andrew; Thakkar, Punam; Weed, Donald T.; Chalian, Ara","Givi, Babak (Department of Otolaryngology, NYU Langone Health, New York, New York, USA); Moore, Michael G.

However, adaptation into clinical practice by heart rhythm healthcare practitioners (HCPs) is unclear. Objective: To examine HCP perspectives on use of commercial technologies for AF detection and management. Methods: We created an electronic survey for HCPs assessing practice demographics and perspectives on digital devices for AF detection and management. The survey was distributed electronically to all members of 3 heart rhythm professional societies. Results: We received 1601 responses out of 73,563 e-mails sent, with 43.6% from cardiac electrophysiologists, 12.8% from fellows, and 11.6% from advanced practice practitioners. Most respondents (62.3%) reported having recommended patient use of a digital device for AF detection. Those who did not had concerns about their accuracy (29.6%), clinical utility of results (22.8%), and integration into electronic health records (19.8%). Results from a 30-second single-lead electrocardiogram were sufficient for 42.7% of HCPs to recommend oral anticoagulation for patients at high risk for stroke. Respondents wanted more data comparing the accuracy of digital devices to conventional devices for AF monitoring (64.9%). A quarter (27.3%) of HCPs had no reservations recommending digital devices for AF detection, and most (53.4%) wanted guidelines from their professional societies providing guidance on their optimal use. Conclusion: Many HCPs have already integrated digital devices into their clinical practice. However, HCPs reported facing challenges when using digital technologies for AF detection, and professional society recommendations on their use are needed.",,,,,2020-07,2020,1,1,21-29,All OA; Gold,Article,"Ding, Eric Y.; Svennberg, Emma; Wurster, Christina; Duncker, David; Manninger, Martin; Lubitz, Steven A.; Dickson, Emily; Fitzgibbons, Timothy P.; Akoum, Nazem; Al-Khatib, Sana M.; Attia, Zachi I.; Ghanbari, Hamid; Marrouche, Nassir F.; Mendenhall, G.

Rethinking resource depletion.,"Since the 1970s, environmentalists have warned that overconsumption, especially of minerals and fossil fuels, will lead to resource depletion. But there are compelling reasons to question the assertion that we are running out. On the one hand, new technologies and discoveries have increased the supply of petroleum and natural gas. On the other, concerns about global climate change and the competitiveness of renewable energy are turning coal into a sunset industry and threaten to transform oil reserves into stranded assets. In contrast to fossil fuels, which are consumed in the process of generating energy, virtually all of the metals excavated in the past remain available even after they have been put to use. Even though the average size and degree of mineralization of recently-discovered ore bodies is on the decline, there has never been as much copper, silver, and gold available for human consumption as there is today. Whether incorporated into digital technology or infrastructure, the majority of metals remain available for recycling, which is generally less expensive, uses less energy, and has fewer environmental impacts than extracting minerals from the earth. The threat posed by climate change from continued use of fossil fuels, and the impacts of environmental degradation caused by resource extraction, demand greater attention than the misleading specter of peak oil or running out of metals.","This research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.

Longstanding and intergenerational economic inequalities have been laid bare by the ensuing economic recession. This special issue's focus on how people critique, challenge, negotiate and change inequities is therefore particularly (and, unfortunately) relevant and timely. These three papers approach critical consciousness from three distinct angles. In this commentary, I will offer several points of praise for these three papers, along with a few suggestions on ways that the authors' lines of thinking could be extended or more nuanced. I will identify a few themes that cut across these three papers: (1) the importance of focusing on critical action, (2) how these papers advance our thinking on how, when, and for whom CC develops, with specific attention paid to the social identities, life phases, and events that impact CC, and (3) a deepening of our understanding of the antecedents and consequences of CC. In reviewing these three papers, I consider how each of them adds to the collective conversation about the ways that we might recognize, challenge, and work to change marginalizing systems and transform inequity to create a more just world.",,Journal of Applied Developmental Psychology,,,2020-07,2020,70,,101192,"All OA; Green, Published",Article,"Diemer, Matthew A","Diemer, Matthew A (University of Michigan, Combined Program in Education & Psychology, Educational Studies, Room 4120, School of Education, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, USA.)","Diemer, Matthew A (University of Michigan)","Diemer, Matthew A (University of Michigan)",University of Michigan,grid.214458.e,United States,,0,0,,,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7477635,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1130654953,1702 Cognitive Sciences; 17 Psychology and Cognitive Sciences; 1701 Psychology,10 Reduced Inequalities

We study spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA), a progressive degenerative disorder of the neuromuscular system caused by the polyQ androgen receptor (AR). Using a knock-in mouse model of SBMA, AR113Q mice, we show that E3 ubiquitin ligases which are a hallmark of the canonical muscle atrophy machinery are not induced in AR113Q muscle. Similarly, we find no evidence to suggest dysfunction of signaling pathways that trigger muscle hypertrophy or impairment of the muscle stem cell niche. Instead, we find that skeletal muscle atrophy is characterized by diminished function of the transcriptional regulator Myocyte Enhancer Factor 2 (MEF2), a regulator of myofiber homeostasis. Decreased expression of MEF2 target genes is age- and glutamine tract length-dependent, occurs due to polyQ AR proteotoxicity, and is associated with sequestration of MEF2 into intranuclear inclusions in muscle. Skeletal muscle from R6/2 mice, a model of Huntington disease which develops progressive atrophy, also sequesters MEF2 into inclusions and displays age-dependent loss of MEF2 target genes. Similarly, SBMA patient muscle shows loss of MEF2 target gene expression, and restoring MEF2 activity in AR113Q muscle rescues fiber size and MEF2-regulated gene expression. This work establishes MEF2 impairment as a novel mechanism of skeletal muscle atrophy downstream of toxic polyglutamine proteins and as a therapeutic target for muscle atrophy in these disorders.",We thank Michael Greenberg for providing the MEF2-VP16 (CA-MEF2) and MEF2ΔDBD-VP16 (DBD-MEF2) plasmids.,Acta Neuropathologica,,,2020-07,2020,140,1,63-80,All OA; Gold,Article,"Nath, Samir R.; Lieberman, Matthew L.; Yu, Zhigang; Marchioretti, Caterina; Jones, Samuel T.; Danby, Emily C.

The impact of the Surgeon General's Call to Action in 2008 has been lower than expected given the public health impact of this disease. This scientific statement highlights future research priorities in VTE, developed by experts and a crowdsourcing survey across 16 scientific organizations. At the fundamental research level (T0), researchers need to identify pathobiologic causative mechanisms for the 50% of patients with unprovoked VTE and better understand mechanisms that differentiate hemostasis from thrombosis. At the human level (T1), new methods for diagnosing, treating, and preventing VTE will allow tailoring of diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to individuals. At the patient level (T2), research efforts are required to understand how foundational evidence impacts care of patients (eg, biomarkers). New treatments, such as catheter-based therapies, require further testing to identify which patients are most likely to experience benefit. At the practice level (T3), translating evidence into practice remains challenging. Areas of overuse and underuse will require evidence-based tools to improve care delivery. At the community and population level (T4), public awareness campaigns need thorough impact assessment. Large population-based cohort studies can elucidate the biologic and environmental underpinings of VTE and its complications. To achieve these goals, funding agencies and training programs must support a new generation of scientists and clinicians who work in multidisciplinary teams to solve the pressing public health problem of VTE.",,Research and Practice in Thrombosis and Haemostasis,,,2020-07,2020,4,5,714-721,All OA; Gold,Article,"Cushman, Mary; Barnes, Geoffrey D.; Creager, Mark A.; Diaz, Jose A.; Henke, Peter K.; Machlus, Kellie R.; Nieman, Marvin T.; Wolberg, Alisa S.; the American Heart Association Council on Peripheral Vascular Disease, Council on Arteriosclerosis","Cushman, Mary (Department of Medicine, Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Larner College of Medicine at the University of Vermont, Burlington, VT, USA); Barnes, Geoffrey D.

DESIGN: Validated electronic survey. SETTING: Vanderbilt University Medical Center Department of Plastic Surgery. PARTICIPANTS: Program directors of all ACMGE-accredited General Surgery, Integrated Vascular Surgery, Integrated Thoracic Surgery, and Integrated Plastic Surgery residency programs. RESULTS: The overall response rate was 55.5%. Most PDs (78.1%) disagreed with the scoring change. Only 19.6% believe this change will improve medical student well-being. For 63.5% of PDs, medical school pedigree will become more important, and 52.7% believe it will place international medical graduates at a disadvantage. Only 6.2% believe Step 2 CK should also be pass/fail, while 88.7% will increase the weight of Step 2 CK and 88.4% will now require Step 2 CK score submission with the electronic residency application service. CONCLUSIONS: While well-intentioned, changing USMLE Step 1 to pass/fail may have unintended consequences and may disadvantage certain groups of applicants. The emphasis on Step 1, and resulting test-taking apprehension, will likely shift to Step 2 CK. Proponents of equitable evaluation should direct their efforts toward increasing, not decreasing, the number of objective measures available for student assessment.",,Journal of Surgical Education,,,2020-07,2020,,,,"All OA; Green, Published",Article,"Pontell, Matthew E.; Makhoul, Alan T.; Kumar, Nishant Ganesh; Drolet, Brian C.","Pontell, Matthew E.

The difference between these scores was used as the outcome variable. Data were analysed using bivariate and multivariate linear regression analyses. Results: 2,740 pregnant women from 47 states completed the survey. 25.8% (N=706) stopped in-person visits, 15.2% used video visits (N=415), and 31.8% (N=817) used phone visits for prenatal care as a result of COVID-19. Those planning a hospital birth dropped from 2641 (96.4%) to 2400 (87.7%) following COVID-19.  More than half of women reported increased stress about food running out (59.2%, N=1622), losing a job or household income (63.7%, N=1745), or loss of childcare (56.3%, N=1543). More than a third reported increasing stress about conflict between household members (37.5%, N=1028), and 93% (N=2556) reported increased stress about getting infected with COVID-19. Slightly less than half of respondents (either selves or family members) were healthcare workers (41.4%, N=1133) or worked in essential services (45.5%, N=1246). In multivariate analysis, those reporting higher agreement with COVID-19-related stressors had greater changes in pre- to post-COVID-19 pregnancy-related anxiety.Conclusions:  The COVID-19 pandemic is profoundly affecting pregnant women’s mental health, and factors independent of pregnancy appear to be driving changes in pregnancy-specific anxiety.",,Research Square,,,2020-06-26,2020,,,,"All OA; Green, Published",Preprint,"Moyer, Cheryl A; Compton, Sarah D; Kaselitz, Elizabeth; Muzik, Maria","Moyer, Cheryl A (University of Michigan); Compton, Sarah D (University of Michigan); Kaselitz, Elizabeth (University of Michigan); Muzik, Maria (University of Michigan)",,"Moyer, Cheryl A (University of Michigan); Compton, Sarah D (University of Michigan); Kaselitz, Elizabeth (University of Michigan); Muzik, Maria (University of Michigan)",University of Michigan,grid.214458.e,United States,,1,1,,,,https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-37887/v1,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1128800972,1117 Public Health and Health Services; 11 Medical and Health Sciences,

Cases were confirmed by laboratory test and were analyzed for epidemiological, demographic, clinical, radiological features and patterns.Results 29 initial scans and 23 follow-up scans were obtained from 29 patients. 15(52%) patients had been to Hubei Province and 26 (90%) of them had close contact with the COVID-19 positive patients in 14 days prior to the illness onset. The peak severity time was 5-8 days after symptom onset. A significant difference between the number of involved segments at different time points was indicated (p=0.019). Half (52%) of the laboratory confirmed patients had no CT positive findings. Nine (31%) of the laboratory confirmed patients had no symptoms. Six (21%) had no CT positive findings nor symptoms. All the patients of one center(n=6) whose fecal samples remained positive after the respiratory samples became negative.Conclusion The common positive CT findings included ground-glass opacities (50%), ground-glass opacities mixed with consolidation (36%), peribronchial thickening (21%), and consolidations (14%).

Due to the rapid outbreak of the transmission (~3.64 million positive cases and high mortality as of 5 May 2020), the world is looking for immediate and better therapeutic options. Still, much information is not known, including origin of the disease, complete genomic characterization, mechanism of transmission dynamics, extent of spread, possible genetic predisposition, clinical and biological diagnosis, complete details of disease-induced pathogenicity, and possible therapeutic options. Although several known drugs are already under clinical evaluation with many in repositioning strategies, much attention has been paid to the aminoquinoline derivates, chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ). These molecules are known regulators of endosomes/lysosomes, which are subcellular organelles central to autophagy processes. By elevating the pH of acidic endosomes/lysosomes, CQ/HCQ inhibit the autophagic process. In this short perspective, we discuss the roles of CQ/HCQ in the treatment of COVID-19 patients and propose new ways of possible treatment for SARS-CoV-2 infection based on the molecules that selectivity target autophagy.Abbreviation: ACE2: angiotensin I converting enzyme 2; CoV: coronavirus; CQ: chloroquine; ER: endoplasmic reticulum; HCQ: hydroxychloroquine; MERS-CoV: Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus; SARS-CoV: severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus; SARS-CoV-2: severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.","Supported by the Institut National de la Santé et de la Recherche Médicale (INSERM), Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS), Sorbonne Université, Université de Paris, the Laboratory of Excellence Medalis (ANR-10-LABX-0034), Initiative of Excellence (IdEx)-Strasbourg University, the University of Strasbourg Institute for Advanced Study (USIAS), and GM131919 from the NIH.

While the virus is well-known for its trademark effects on respiratory function, neurological damage has been reported to affect a considerable proportion of severe cases. To characterize the neuro-invasive potential of this disease, a contemporary review of COVID-19 and its neurological sequelae was conducted using the limited, but growing, literature that is available. These neurological squeal are based on the manifestations that the virus has on normal central and peripheral nervous system function. The authors present the virology of the SARS-CoV-2 agent by analyzing its classification as an enveloped, positive-stranded RNA virus. A comprehensive timeline is then presented, indicating the progression of the disease as a public health threat. Furthermore, underlying chronic neurological conditions potentially lead to more adverse cases of COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 may reach ACE2 receptors on neuronal tissue through mode of the general circulation. The CNS may also be susceptible to an immune response where a ""cytokine storm"" can manifest into neural injury. Histological evidence is provided, while symptoms such as headache and vertigo are highlighted as CNS manifestations of COVID-19. Treatment of these symptoms is addressed with paracetamol being recommended as a possible, but not conclusive, treatment to some CNS symptoms. The authors then discuss the peripheral nervous system sequelae and COVID's impact on causing chemosensory dysfunction starting with viral attack on olfactory sensory neurons and cells types within the lining of the nose. Histological evidence is also provided while symptoms such as anosmia and ageusia are characterized as PNS manifestations. Possible treatment options for these symptoms are then addressed as a major limitation, as anecdotal, and not conclusive evidence can be made.

In particular, heat decontamination is a treatment method that scales well and can be implemented in settings with variable or limited resources. Prior studies using multiple inactivation methods, however, have often focused on a single virus under narrowly defined conditions, making it difficult to develop guiding principles for inactivating emerging or difficult-to-culture viruses. We systematically explored how temperature, humidity, and virus deposition solutions impact the inactivation of viruses deposited and dried on N95 respirator coupons. We exposed four virus surrogates across a range of structures and phylogenies, including two bacteriophages (MS2 and phi6), a mouse coronavirus (murine hepatitis virus, MHV), and a recombinant human influenza A virus subtype H3N2 (IAV), to heat treatment for 30 minutes in multiple deposition solutions across several temperatures and relative humidities (RH). We observed that elevated RH was essential for effective heat inactivation of all four viruses tested. For heat treatments between 72°C and 82°C, RH greater than 50% resulted in > 6-log10 inactivation of bacteriophages and RH greater than 25% resulted in > 3.5-log10 inactivation of MHV and IAV. Furthermore, deposition of viruses in host cell culture media greatly enhanced virus inactivation by heat and humidity compared to other deposition solutions such as phosphate buffered saline, phosphate buffered saline with bovine serum albumin, and human saliva. Past and future heat treatment methods or technologies must therefore explicitly account for deposition solutions as a factor that will strongly influence observed virus inactivation rates. Overall, our data set can inform the design and validation of effective heat-based decontamination strategies for N95 respirators and other porous surfaces, especially for emerging or low-titer viruses that may be of immediate public health concern such as SARS-CoV-2.",,medRxiv,,,2020-06-23,2020,,,2020.06.22.20137448,"All OA; Green, Published",Preprint,"Rockey, Nicole; Arts, Peter J.; Li, Lucinda; Harrison, Katherine R.; Langenfeld, Kathryn; Fitzsimmons, William J.; Lauring, Adam S.; Love, Nancy G.; Kaye, Keith S.; Raskin, Lutgarde; Roberts, William W.; Hegarty, Bridget; Wigginton, Krista R.","Rockey, Nicole (University of Michigan;); Arts, Peter J.

Macroeconomic models which use preexisting epidemic models to calculate the impacts of a disease outbreak are therefore extremely useful for policymakers seeking to evaluate the best course of action in such a crisis. We develop an SIR model of the COVID-19 pandemic which explicitly considers herd immunity, behavior-dependent transmission rates, remote workers, and indirect externalities of lockdown. This model is presented as an exit time control problem where the lockdown ends when the population achieves herd immunity, either naturally or via a vaccine. A social planner prescribes separate levels of lockdown for two separate sections of the adult population - those who are low-risk (ages 20-64) and those who are high-risk (ages 65 and over). These levels are determined via optimization of an objective function which assigns a macroeconomic cost to the level of lockdown and the number of deaths. We find that, by ending lockdowns once herd immunity is reached, high-risk individuals are able to leave lockdown significantly before the arrival of a vaccine without causing large increases in mortality. Additionally, if we incorporate a behavior-dependent transmission rate which represents increased personal caution in response to increased infection levels, both output loss and total mortality are lowered. Lockdown efficacy is further increased when there is less interaction between low- and high-risk individuals, and increased remote work decreases output losses. Overall, our model predicts that a lockdown which ends at the arrival of herd immunity, combined with individual actions to slow virus transmission, can reduce total mortality to one-third of the no-lockdown level, while allowing high-risk individuals to leave lockdown well before vaccine arrival.",,medRxiv,,,2020-06-23,2020,,,2020.06.22.20137711,"All OA; Green, Published",Preprint,"Bayraktar, Erhan; Cohen, Asaf; Nellis, April","Bayraktar, Erhan (University of Michigan); Cohen, Asaf (University of Michigan); Nellis, April (University of Michigan)",,"Bayraktar, Erhan (University of Michigan); Cohen, Asaf (University of Michigan); Nellis, April (University of Michigan)",University of Michigan,grid.214458.e,United States,,0,0,,,27,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2020/06/23/2020.06.22.20137711.full.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1128713756,1117 Public Health and Health Services; 11 Medical and Health Sciences,3 Good Health and Well Being

However, insufficient consideration of appropriate methodologies in the guideline development could lead to misleading information, uncertainty among professionals, and potentially harmful actions for patients. Purpose: Rapid systematic review of clinical practice guidelines and recommendations in the context of COVID-19 to explore if basic methodological standards of guideline development have been met. Data sources: MEDLINE [PubMed], CINAHL [Ebsco], Trip and manual search; from Feb 1st 2020 until April 27th 2020. Study selection: All types of healthcare workers providing any kind of healthcare to any patient population in any setting. Data extraction: At least two reviewers independently extracted guideline characteristics, conducted critical appraisal according to The Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation Instrument (AGREE II) and classified the guidelines using the Association of the Scientific Medical Societies (AWMF) Guidance Manual and Rules for Guideline Development. We plan six-month updates (living review). Data synthesis: There were 1342 titles screened and 188 guidelines included. The highest average AGREE II domain score was 89% for scope and purpose, the lowest for rigor of development (25%). Only eight guidelines (4%) were based on a systematic literature search and a structured consensus process by representative experts (classified as the highest methodological quality, S3 according to AWMF). Patients were only included in the development of one guideline. A process for regular updates was described in 27 guidelines (14%). Limitations: Methodological focus only. Conclusions: Despite clear scope, most publications fell short of basic methodological standards of guideline development. Future research should monitor the evolving methodological quality of the guidelines and their updates over time.

Design: Mendelian randomisation analysis. Setting: UK Biobank and HUNT study population-based cohorts for risk of sepsis, and genome-wide association study summary data for risk of severe covid-19 with respiratory failure. Participants: 12,455 sepsis cases (519,885 controls) and 1,610 severe covid-19 with respiratory failure cases (2,205 controls). Exposure: Genetic variants that proxy body mass index (BMI), lipid traits, systolic blood pressure, lifetime smoking score, and type 2 diabetes liability - derived from studies considering between 188,577 to 898,130 participants. Main outcome measures: Risk of sepsis and severe covid-19 with respiratory failure. Results: Higher genetically proxied BMI and lifetime smoking score were associated with increased risk of sepsis in both UK Biobank (BMI: odds ratio 1.38 per standard deviation increase, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.27 to 1.51; smoking: odds ratio 2.81 per standard deviation increase, 95% CI 2.09-3.79) and HUNT (BMI: 1.41, 95% CI 1.18 to 1.69; smoking: 1.93, 95% CI 1.02-3.64). Higher genetically proxied BMI and lifetime smoking score were also associated with increased risk of severe covid-19, although with wider confidence intervals (BMI: 1.75, 95% CI 1.20 to 2.57; smoking: 3.94, 95% CI 1.13 to 13.75). There was limited evidence to support associations of genetically proxied lipid traits, systolic blood pressure or type 2 diabetes liability with risk of sepsis or severe covid-19. Similar findings were generally obtained when using Mendelian randomization methods that are more robust to the inclusion of pleiotropic variants, although the precision of estimates was reduced. Conclusions: Our findings support a causal effect of elevated BMI and smoking on risk of sepsis and severe covid-19. Clinical and public health interventions targeting obesity and smoking are likely to reduce sepsis and covid-19 related morbidity, along with the plethora of other health-related outcomes that these traits adversely affect.",,medRxiv,,,2020-06-20,2020,,,2020.06.18.20134676,"All OA; Green, Published",Preprint,"Mark, Ponsford J; Gkatzionis, Apostolos; Walker, Venexia; Grant, Andrew; Wootton, Robyn E; Moore, Luke S P; Fatumo, Segun; Mason, Amy; Zuber, Verena; Willer, Cristen; Rasheed, Humaira; Brumpton, Ben; Hveem, Kristian; Damas, Jan Kristian; Davies, Neil M; Asvold, Bjorn Olav; Solligard, Erik; Jones, Simon; Burgess, Stephen; Rogne, Tormod; Gill, Dipender","Mark, Ponsford J (University Hospital Wales;); Gkatzionis, Apostolos (University of Cambridge;); Walker, Venexia (University of Bristol;); Grant, Andrew (University of Cambridge;); Wootton, Robyn E (University of Bristol;); Moore, Luke S P (Chelsea & Westminster NHS Foundation Trust;); Fatumo, Segun (London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine;); Mason, Amy (University of Cambridge;); Zuber, Verena (Imperial College London;); Willer, Cristen (University of Michigan;); Rasheed, Humaira (Norwegian University of Science and Technology;); Brumpton, Ben (Norwegian University of Science and Technology;); Hveem, Kristian (Norwegian University of Science and Technology;); Damas, Jan Kristian (Norwegian University of Science and Technology;); Davies, Neil M (University of Bristol;); Asvold, Bjorn Olav (Norwegian University of Science and Technology;); Solligard, Erik (Norwegian University of Science and Technology;); Jones, Simon (Cardiff University); Burgess, Stephen (University of Cambridge;); Rogne, Tormod (Norwegian University of Science and Technology;); Gill, Dipender (Imperial College London;)",,"Mark, Ponsford J (); Gkatzionis, Apostolos (University of Cambridge); Walker, Venexia (University of Bristol); Grant, Andrew (University of Cambridge); Wootton, Robyn E (University of Bristol); Moore, Luke S P (); Fatumo, Segun (London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine); Mason, Amy (University of Cambridge); Zuber, Verena (Imperial College London); Willer, Cristen (University of Michigan); Rasheed, Humaira (Norwegian University of Science and Technology); Brumpton, Ben (Norwegian University of Science and Technology); Hveem, Kristian (Norwegian University of Science and Technology); Damas, Jan Kristian (Norwegian University of Science and Technology); Davies, Neil M (University of Bristol); Asvold, Bjorn Olav (Norwegian University of Science and Technology); Solligard, Erik (Norwegian University of Science and Technology); Jones, Simon (Cardiff University); Burgess, Stephen (University of Cambridge); Rogne, Tormod (Norwegian University of Science and Technology); Gill, Dipender (Imperial College London)",University of Michigan; Cardiff University; London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine; Norwegian University of Science and Technology; University of Bristol; University of Cambridge; Imperial College London,grid.214458.e; grid.5600.3; grid.8991.9; grid.5947.f; grid.5337.2; grid.5335.0; grid.7445.2,United States; United Kingdom; United Kingdom; Norway; United Kingdom; United Kingdom; United Kingdom,,2,2,,,8,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2020/06/20/2020.06.18.20134676.full.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1128663179,1117 Public Health and Health Services; 11 Medical and Health Sciences,

However, despite their long-term use and only few case reports on adverse effects, CQ and HCQ are listed as a known risk of the lethal ventricular arrhythmia Torsade de Pointes and their cardiac safety profile is being questioned. Thus, we aimed to investigate the electrocardiographic and mortality effects of CQ and HCQ in a primary care population. Methods: We used Danish health care registers and electrocardiograms (ECGs) from primary care to define three studies. 1) A paired study of subjects with ECGs before and during use of CQ/HCQ, 2) a matched ECG study of subjects taking CQ/HCQ compared to controls, and 3) a mortality study on people taking HCQ matched to control. In both matched studies, we adjusted for connective tissue diseases, use of QT-prolonging drugs, and cardiac disease. We used the QTc interval as the marker for electrocardiographic safety. In the mortality study, cases were followed from first claimed prescription until 300 days after estimated completion of the last prescription. 95% confidence intervals follow estimates in parenthesis. Results: Use of CQ was associated with a 5.5 (0.7;10) ms increase in QTc in the paired study (n=10). In the matched study (n=28, controls=280), QTc was insignificantly increased in subjects taking CQ by 4.7 (-3.4;13) ms. With a ΔQTc of 1.0 (-5.6;7.5), use of HCQ was not associated with an increased QTc in the paired study (n=32). In the matched study (n=172, controls=1,720), QTc also was not different between groups (p=0.5). In the mortality study (n=3,368), use of HCQ was associated with a hazard ratio of 0.67 (0.43;1.05).

Every day, we, scientists, listen to the latest news with its promises and announcements. Across the world, a surge of clinical trials trying to cure or slow down the coronavirus pandemic has been launched to bring hope instead of fear and despair. One first proposed clinical trial has drawn worldwide hype to the benefit of chloroquine (CQ), in the treatment of patients infected by the recently emerged deadly coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). We should consider this information in light of the long-standing anti-inflammatory and anti-viral properties of CQ-related drugs. Yet, none of the articles promoting the use of CQ in the current pandemic evoked a possible molecular or cellular mechanism of action that could account for any efficacy.

The use of influential epidemiological models of COVID-19 helped to encourage decision makers to take drastic non-pharmaceutical interventions. Yet, inherent in these models are often assumptions that the active interventions are static, e.g., that social distancing is enforced until infections are minimized, which can lead to inaccurate predictions that are ever evolving as new data is assimilated. We present a methodology to dynamically guide the active intervention by shifting the focus from viewing epidemiological models as systems that evolve in autonomous fashion to control systems with an ""input"" that can be varied in time in order to change the evolution of the system. We show that a safety-critical control approach to COVID-19 mitigation gives active intervention policies that formally guarantee the safe evolution of compartmental epidemiological models. This perspective is applied to current US data on cases while taking into account reduction of mobility, and we find that it accurately describes the current trends when time delays associated with incubation and testing are incorporated. Optimal active intervention policies are synthesized to determine future mitigations necessary to bound infections, hospitalizations, and death, both at national and state levels. We therefore provide means in which to model and modulate active interventions with a view toward the phased reopenings that are currently beginning across the US and the world in a decentralized fashion. This framework can be converted into public policies, accounting for the fractured landscape of COVID-19 mitigation in a safety-critical fashion.",,medRxiv,,,2020-06-19,2020,,,2020.06.17.20133264,"All OA; Green, Published",Preprint,"Ames, Aaron D; Molnar, Tamas G; Singletary, Andrew W; Orosz, Gabor","Ames, Aaron D (California Institute of Technology;); Molnar, Tamas G (University of Michigan, Ann Arbor); Singletary, Andrew W (California Institute of Technology;); Orosz, Gabor (University of Michigan, Ann Arbor)",,"Ames, Aaron D (California Institute of Technology); Molnar, Tamas G (University of Michigan); Singletary, Andrew W (California Institute of Technology); Orosz, Gabor (University of Michigan)",University of Michigan; California Institute of Technology,grid.214458.e; grid.20861.3d,United States; United States,,0,0,,,4,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2020/06/19/2020.06.17.20133264.full.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1128630656,1117 Public Health and Health Services; 11 Medical and Health Sciences,

Reasons for this disparity have not been well-characterized but may be due to underlying comorbidities or sociodemographic factors. OBJECTIVE: To systematically determine patient characteristics associated with racial/ethnic disparities in COVID-19 outcomes. DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study with comparative control groups. SETTING: Patients tested for COVID-19 at University of Michigan Medicine from March 10, 2020 to April 22, 2020. PARTICIPANTS: 5,698 tested patients and two sets of comparison groups who were not tested for COVID-19: randomly selected unmatched controls (n = 7,211) and frequency-matched controls by race, age, and sex (n = 13,351). Main Outcomes and Measures: We identified factors associated with testing and testing positive for COVID-19, being hospitalized, requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and mortality (in/out-patient during the time frame). Factors included race/ethnicity, age, smoking, alcohol consumption, healthcare utilization, and residential-level socioeconomic characteristics (SES; i.e., education, unemployment, population density, and poverty rate). Medical comorbidities were defined from the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes, and were aggregated into a comorbidity score. RESULTS: Of 5,698 patients, (median age, 47 years; 38% male; mean BMI, 30.1), the majority were non-Hispanic Whites (NHW, 59.2%) and non-Hispanic Black/African-Americans (NHAA, 17.2%). Among 1,119 diagnosed, there were 41.2% NHW and 37.4% NHAA; 44.8% hospitalized, 20.6% admitted to ICU, and 3.8% died. Adjusting for age, sex, and SES, NHAA were 1.66 times more likely to be hospitalized (95% CI, 1.09-2.52; P=.02), 1.52 times more likely to enter ICU (95% CI, 0.92-2.52; P=.10). In addition to older age, male sex and obesity, high population density neighborhood (OR, 1.27 associated with one SD change [95% CI, 1.20-1.76]; P=.02) was associated with hospitalization.

Social distancing became the main policy for public behavior, in effect imposing radical changes in people’s everyday life. Thus, mental health may be affected at the general population level and not only among those who have been infected by the disease or have witnessed family members or close ones fall ill.Methods A cross-sectional online survey was conducted in Norway, UK, USA and Australia during April/May 2020. Participants (n = 3810) were recruited via social media postings by the researchers and the involved universities. Differences between those with and without infection in the family were investigated with chi-square tests and independent t-tests. Multiple regression analyses were used to assess associations between sociodemographic variables and psychological outcomes (worry, loneliness and mental health) in both groups.Results Compared to their counterparts, participants with infection in the family reported higher levels of worries about themselves (p < 0.05) and their family members (p < 0.001), and had poorer mental health (p < 0.05). However, the effect sizes related to the differences were small. The largest effect (d = 0.24) concerned worries about their immediate family. Poorer psychological outcomes were observed in those who were younger, female, unemployed, living alone and had lower levels of edcuation, yet with small effect sizes.Conclusions In view of the small differences between those with and without infection, we generally conclude that the mental health effects of the COVID-19 situation are not limited to those who have been infected or have had infection within the family, but extend to the general population.",,Research Square,,,2020-06-17,2020,,,,"All OA; Green, Accepted & Submitted",Preprint,"Bonsaksen, Tore; Leung, Janni; Schoultz, Mariyana; Thygesen, Hilde; Price, Daicia; Ruffolo, Mary; Geirdal, Amy Østertun","Bonsaksen, Tore (OsloMet - Oslo Metropolitan University); Leung, Janni (University of Queensland); Schoultz, Mariyana (University of Salford); Thygesen, Hilde (VID Vitenskapelige Hogskole); Price, Daicia (University of Michigan); Ruffolo, Mary (University of Michigan); Geirdal, Amy Østertun ()",,"Bonsaksen, Tore (); Leung, Janni (University of Queensland); Schoultz, Mariyana (University of Salford); Thygesen, Hilde (); Price, Daicia (University of Michigan); Ruffolo, Mary (University of Michigan); Geirdal, Amy Østertun ()",University of Queensland; University of Salford; University of Michigan,grid.1003.2; grid.8752.8; grid.214458.e,Australia; United Kingdom; United States,,0,0,,,1,http://nrl.northumbria.ac.uk/id/eprint/44028/1/1c5c2b7e-66a1-4a73-8a1d-cfbc32ed9d11.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1128568943,1117 Public Health and Health Services; 11 Medical and Health Sciences,

IPV is associated with an increased risk of homicide, with firearms as the most commonly used weapon. We designed this study to better understand the impact of interpersonal trauma exposure and demographic factors on firearm perceptions among a cohort of IPV-exposed women. Methods267 women in central Pennsylvania with exposure to IPV were surveyed about perceptions of gun access, safety, and gun presence in the home. Trauma variables included IPV type, IPV recency, unwanted sexual exposure, and adverse childhood experiences (ACEs). Multivariable analyses examined each of the three firearm perception questions controlling for trauma exposures and demographics. ResultsEase of firearm acquisition: Women who reported physical IPV (aOR2.40, 95%CI 1.20,4.81), women who reported past year unwanted sexual exposure (aOR4.01, 95% CI 1.00,16.03), and women of ages 47-54 (aOR3.57 95%CI 1.49,8.55) reported that guns were easy to acquire, compared to women ages 19-34. Perceived safety in the proximity of a gun: Women with the highest ACE score were less likely to feel safe with a gun nearby (aOR0.41, 95%CI 0.21,0.84). Rural women (aOR4.13, 95%CI 1.55,11.01), and women ages 35-46 had increased odds (aOR2.88, 95%CI 1.35,6.12) of reporting that guns made them feel safer. Odds of guns in the home: Women who were divorced or separated (aOR0.22, 95%CI 0.09,0.54) and women were widowed or single (aOR0.22, 95%CI 0.07,0.68) had lower odds of having a gun in the home, compared to married women. Rural women had higher odds of living in a home with a gun (aOR3.30, 95%CI 1.04,10.49). There was no significant effect of the trauma variables on the odds of having a gun at home. ConclusionsTrauma exposures, including physical IPV and past-year unwanted sexual exposure, were associated with women’s perceptions that it was easier to acquire guns in their community. Women with more severe childhood trauma felt less safe around firearms, but trauma exposures did not predict gun ownership. Instead, demographics of being married and rural residence were associated with gun ownership.",,Research Square,,,2020-06-17,2020,,,,"All OA; Green, Published",Preprint,"Leuenberger, Laura; McCall-Hosenfeld, Jennifer; Lehman, Erik","Leuenberger, Laura (University of Michigan); McCall-Hosenfeld, Jennifer (Penn State College of Medicine); Lehman, Erik (Pennsylvania State University)",,"Leuenberger, Laura (University of Michigan); McCall-Hosenfeld, Jennifer (); Lehman, Erik (Pennsylvania State University)",Pennsylvania State University; University of Michigan,grid.29857.31; grid.214458.e,United States; United States,,0,0,,,,https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-31669/v1.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1128568868,1117 Public Health and Health Services; 11 Medical and Health Sciences,"16 Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions"

There is, however, no effective antiviral drug that can be used to treat COVID-19 to date. Built on the fact that SARS-CoV-2 initiates its entry into human cells by the receptor binding domain (RBD) of its spike protein binding to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2), we extended a recently developed approach, EvoDesign, to design multiple peptide sequences that can competitively bind to the SARS-CoV-2 RBD to inhibit the virus from entering human cells. The protocol starts with the construction of a hybrid peptidic scaffold by linking two fragments grafted from the interface of the hACE2 protein (a.a. 22-44 and 351-357) with a linker glycine, which is followed by the redesign and refinement simulations of the peptide sequence to optimize its binding affinity to the interface of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD. The binding experiment analyses showed that the designed peptides exhibited a significantly stronger binding potency to hACE2 than the wild-type hACE2 receptor (with -53.35 vs. -46.46 EvoEF2 energy unit scores for the top designed and wild-type peptides, respectively). This study demonstrates a new avenue to utilize computationally designed peptide motifs to treat the COVID-19 disease by blocking the critical spike-RBD and hACE2 interactions.","ACKNOWLEDGMENTS We thank the XSEDE clusters [44] which is supported by the National Science Foundation (ACI-1548562) for providing computational resources.",Aging,,"Amino Acid Sequence; Antiviral Agents; Binding Sites; Coronavirus Infections; Drug Design; Evolution, Molecular; Humans; Models, Molecular; Pandemics; Peptides; Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A; Pneumonia, Viral; Protein Binding; Protein Conformation; Spike Glycoprotein, Coronavirus; Virus Internalization",2020-06-16,2020,12,12,11263-11276,"All OA; Green, Published",Article,"Huang, Xiaoqiang; Pearce, Robin; Zhang, Yang","Huang, Xiaoqiang (Department of Computational Medicine and Bioinformatics, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, USA.); Pearce, Robin (Department of Computational Medicine and Bioinformatics, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, USA.); Zhang, Yang (Department of Computational Medicine and Bioinformatics, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, USA.; Department of Biological Chemistry, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, USA.)",,"Huang, Xiaoqiang (); Pearce, Robin (); Zhang, Yang (University of Michigan)",University of Michigan,grid.214458.e,United States,National Institute of General Medical Sciences; National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases; Directorate for Computer & Information Science & Engineering,11,11,,,7,http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc7343451?pdf=render,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1128530290,0601 Biochemistry and Cell Biology; 06 Biological Sciences,

METHODS: Annually, 890 to 1441 individuals were followed and contacted weekly to report ARIs. Specimens collected during illness were tested for human coronaviruses (HCoV) types OC43, 229E, HKU1, and NL63. RESULTS: In total, 993 HCoV infections were identified during the 8 years, with OC43 most commonly seen and 229E the least. HCoVs were detected in a limited time period, between December and April/May and peaked in January/February. Highest infection frequency was in children <5 years (18 per 100 person-years), with little variation in older age groups (range, 7 to 11 per 100 person-years). Overall, 9% of adult cases and 20% of cases in children were associated with medical consultation. Of the 993 infections, 260 were acquired from an infected household contact. The serial interval between index and household-acquired cases ranged from 3.2 to 3.6 days and the secondary infection risk ranged from 7.2% to 12.6% by type.

Concerns exist that these disruptions caused by the pandemic may not have influenced men and women researchers equally. Many medical journals have published papers on the pandemic, which were generated by researchers facing the challenges of these disruptions. Here we report the results of an analysis that compared the gender distribution of authors on 1893 medical papers related to the pandemic with that on papers published in the same journals in 2019, for papers with first authors and last authors from the United States. Using mixed-effects regression models, we estimated that the proportion of COVID-19 papers with a woman first author was 19% lower than that for papers published in the same journals in 2019, while our comparisons for last authors and overall proportion of women authors per paper were inconclusive. A closer examination suggested that women's representation as first authors of COVID-19 research was particularly low for papers published in March and April 2020. Our findings are consistent with the idea that the research productivity of women, especially early-career women, has been affected more than the research productivity of men.",The authors declare that there was no funding for this work.,eLife,,"Authorship; Bibliometrics; Coronavirus Infections; Efficiency; Female; Humans; Medicine; Pandemics; Periodicals as Topic; Physicians, Women; Pneumonia, Viral; Research Personnel; Sex Factors; Social Isolation; United States; Women",2020-06-15,2020,9,,e58807,All OA; Gold,Article,"Andersen, Jens Peter; Nielsen, Mathias Wullum; Simone, Nicole L; Lewiss, Resa E; Jagsi, Reshma","Andersen, Jens Peter (Danish Centre for Studies on Research and Research Policy, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark); Nielsen, Mathias Wullum (Department of Sociology, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark); Simone, Nicole L (Department of Radiation Oncology, Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center at Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, United States); Lewiss, Resa E (Department of Emergency Medicine, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, United States); Jagsi, Reshma (Department of Radiation Oncology and Center for Bioethics and Social Sciences in Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, United States)","Jagsi, Reshma (University of Michigan)","Andersen, Jens Peter (Aarhus University); Nielsen, Mathias Wullum (University of Copenhagen); Simone, Nicole L (Thomas Jefferson University); Lewiss, Resa E (Thomas Jefferson University); Jagsi, Reshma (University of Michigan)",University of Copenhagen; Thomas Jefferson University; Aarhus University; University of Michigan,grid.5254.6; grid.265008.9; grid.7048.b; grid.214458.e,Denmark; United States; Denmark; United States,,22,22,,,251,https://doi.org/10.7554/elife.58807,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1128492141,0601 Biochemistry and Cell Biology; 06 Biological Sciences,8 Decent Work and Economic Growth

Using human seasonal influenza viruses in a ferret model, we examined the roles of exposure duration and heterosubtypic immunity on influenza transmission. We found that airborne transmission of seasonal influenza strains is abrogated in recipient animals with pre-existing non-neutralizing immunity, indicating that transmissibility of a given influenza virus strain should be examined in the context of ferrets that are not immunologically naïve.","This work was supported by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (HHSN272201400007C, SSL; 1R01AI139063-01A1, SSL; 1R01AI113047, SEH; 1P01AI108686, SEH; CEIRS HHSN272201400005C, SEH).

Our approach combines advances in generative artificial intelligence (AI) with conventional molecular docking to rapidly explore chemical space conditioned on the unique physiochemical properties of the active site of a biomolecular target. As a proof-of-concept, we used our framework to construct a focused library for cyclin-dependent kinase type-2 (CDK2). We then used it to rapidly generate a library specific to the active site of the main protease (M pro ) of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes COVID-19. By comparing approved and experimental drugs to compounds in our library, we also identified six drugs, namely, Naratriptan, Etryptamine, Panobinostat, Procainamide, Sertraline, and Lidamidine, as possible SARS-CoV-2 M pro targeting compounds and, as such, potential drug repurposing candidates. To complement the open-science COVID-19 drug discovery initiatives, we make our SARS-CoV-2 M pro library fully accessible to the research community ( https://github.com/atfrank/SARS-CoV-2 ).",,bioRxiv,,,2020-06-11,2020,,,2020.06.09.143289,"All OA; Green, Published",Preprint,"Xu, Ziqiao; Wauchope, Orrette; Frank, Aaron T.","Xu, Ziqiao (University of Michigan, Department of Chemistry, Ann Arbor, 48109, United States of America); Wauchope, Orrette (City University of New York, Baruch College, Department of Natural Sciences, New York, 10010, United States of America); Frank, Aaron T.

Unfortunately, traditional drug discovery methods have a >90% failure rate and can take 10-15 years from target identification to clinical use. In contrast, drug repurposing can significantly accelerate translation. We developed a quantitative high-throughput screen to identify efficacious single agents and combination therapies against SARS-CoV-2. Quantitative high-content morphological profiling was coupled with an AI-based machine learning strategy to classify features of cells for infection and stress. This assay detected multiple antiviral mechanisms of action (MOA), including inhibition of viral entry, propagation, and modulation of host cellular responses. From a library of 1,425 FDA-approved compounds and clinical candidates, we identified 16 dose-responsive compounds with antiviral effects. In particular, we discovered that lactoferrin is an effective inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 infection with an IC50 of 308 nM and that it potentiates the efficacy of both remdesivir and hydroxychloroquine. Lactoferrin also stimulates an antiviral host cell response and retains inhibitory activity in iPSC-derived alveolar epithelial cells, a model for the primary site of infection. Given its safety profile in humans, these data suggest that lactoferrin is a readily translatable therapeutic adjunct for COVID-19. Additionally, several commonly prescribed drugs were found to exacerbate viral infection and warrant clinical investigation. We conclude that morphological profiling for drug repurposing is an effective strategy for the selection and optimization of drugs and drug combinations as viable therapeutic options for COVID-19 pandemic and other emerging infectious diseases.","ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS Funding: University of Michigan Institute for Clinical and Health Research (MICHR) (NCATS -UL1TR002240) and its Center for Drug Repurposing.

As COVID-19-related burdens on the health care system and medical schools piled up, questions from medical students far outweighed the capacity of medical school administrators to respond in an adequate or timely manner, leaving students feeling confused and without clear guidance. In this Perspective, incoming and outgoing executive leaders of the University of Michigan Medical School Student Council and medical school deans outline the specific ways they were able to bridge the gap between medical students and administrators in a time of crisis. To illustrate the value of student government during uncertain times, the authors identify the most pressing problems faced by students at each phase of the curriculum-preclerkship, clerkship, and postclerkship-and explain how Student Council leadership partnered with administrators to find creative solutions to these problems and provide guidance to learners. They end by reflecting on the role of student government more broadly, identifying 3 guiding principles of student leadership and how these principles enable effective student representation.",,Academic Medicine,,,2020-06-09,2020,Publish Ahead of Print,,,All OA; Gold,Article,"Schuiteman, Sam; Ibrahim, Nadine I.; Hammoud, Ali; Kruger, Laura; Mangrulkar, Rajesh S.; Daniel, Michelle","Schuiteman, Sam (S.

We conducted a cross-sectional survey with a global sample of gay men and other MSM (n= 2732) from April 16, 2020 to May 4, 2020, through a social networking app. We characterized the economic, mental health, HIV prevention and HIV treatment impacts of COVID-19 and the COVID-19 response, and examined whether subgroups of our study population are disproportionately impacted by COVID-19. Many men not only reported economic and mental health consequences, but also interruptions to HIV prevention and testing, and HIV care and treatment services. Consequences were significantly greater among people living with HIV, racial/ethnic minorities, immigrants, sex workers, and socio-economically disadvantaged groups. Findings underscore the crucial need to mitigate the multifaceted impacts of COVID-19 among gay men and other MSM, especially for those with intersecting vulnerabilities.",,Research Square,,,2020-06-09,2020,,,,"All OA; Green, Published",Preprint,"Santos, Glenn-Milo; Ackerman, Benjamin; Rao, Amrita; Wallach, Sara; Ayala, George; Lamontage, Erik; Garner, Alex; Holloway, Ian; Arreola, Sonya; Silenzio, Vince; Ström, Susanne; Yu, Louis; Strong, Carol; Adamson, Tyler; Yakusik, Anna; Doan, Tran; Huang, Poyao; Cerasuolo, Damiano; Bishop, Amie; Noori, Teymur; Pharris, Anastasia; Aung, Max; Dara, Masoud; Chung, Ssu Yu; Hanley, Marguerite; Baral, Stefan; Beyrer, Chris; Howell, Sean","Santos, Glenn-Milo (University of California San Francisco); Ackerman, Benjamin (Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health); Rao, Amrita (Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health); Wallach, Sara (Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health); Ayala, George (Mpact Global Action); Lamontage, Erik (Joint United Nations Programme on HIV and AIDS); Garner, Alex (Hornet); Holloway, Ian (University of California Los Angeles); Arreola, Sonya (Mpact Global Action); Silenzio, Vince (Rutgers School of Public Health); Ström, Susanne (Karolinska Institutet); Yu, Louis (Gustavus Adolphus College); Strong, Carol (National Cheng Kung University); Adamson, Tyler (Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health); Yakusik, Anna (Joint United Nations Programme on HIV and AIDS); Doan, Tran (University of Michigan); Huang, Poyao (University of California San Diego); Cerasuolo, Damiano (University Hospital of Caen); Bishop, Amie (OutRight Action International); Noori, Teymur (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control); Pharris, Anastasia (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control); Aung, Max (University of Michigan); Dara, Masoud (The World Health Organization); Chung, Ssu Yu (LGBT Foundation); Hanley, Marguerite (Tech4HIV); Baral, Stefan (Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health); Beyrer, Chris (Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health); Howell, Sean (University Hospital of Caen)",,"Santos, Glenn-Milo (University of California, San Francisco); Ackerman, Benjamin (Johns Hopkins University); Rao, Amrita (Johns Hopkins University); Wallach, Sara (Johns Hopkins University); Ayala, George (); Lamontage, Erik (); Garner, Alex (); Holloway, Ian (University of California, Los Angeles); Arreola, Sonya (); Silenzio, Vince (); Ström, Susanne (Karolinska Institute); Yu, Louis (Gustavus Adolphus College); Strong, Carol (National Cheng Kung University); Adamson, Tyler (Johns Hopkins University); Yakusik, Anna (); Doan, Tran (University of Michigan); Huang, Poyao (University of California, San Diego); Cerasuolo, Damiano (); Bishop, Amie (); Noori, Teymur (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control); Pharris, Anastasia (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control); Aung, Max (University of Michigan); Dara, Masoud (); Chung, Ssu Yu (LGBT Foundation); Hanley, Marguerite (); Baral, Stefan (Johns Hopkins University); Beyrer, Chris (Johns Hopkins University); Howell, Sean ()","Johns Hopkins University; University of California, Los Angeles; University of Michigan; Karolinska Institute; University of California, San Diego; LGBT Foundation; University of California, San Francisco; National Cheng Kung University; Gustavus Adolphus College; European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control",grid.21107.35; grid.19006.3e; grid.214458.e; grid.4714.6; grid.266100.3; grid.501070.3; grid.266102.1; grid.64523.36; grid.256667.6; grid.418914.1,United States; United States; United States; Sweden; United States; United Kingdom; United States; Taiwan; United States; Sweden,,0,0,,,18,https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-33958/v1.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1128374225,1608 Sociology; 1117 Public Health and Health Services; 11 Medical and Health Sciences; 16 Studies in Human Society,3 Good Health and Well Being

We examine an ensemble of public health metrics to assess the control of COVID-19 epidemic in women- versus men-led countries worldwide based on data available up to June 3. The median of the distribution of median time-varying effective reproduction number for women- and men-led countries were 0.89 and 1.14 respectively with the 95% two-sample bootstrap-based confidence interval for the difference (women - men) being [-0.34, 0.02].

We compared the performance of four of these assays that were being evaluated for use at our institution: Abbott RealTime m2000 SARS-CoV-2 Assay, DiaSorin Simplexa COVID-19 Direct, Cepheid Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 and Abbott ID NOW COVID-19. Nasopharyngeal and nasal specimens were collected from 88 ED and hospital-admitted patients and tested by the four methods in parallel to compare performance. ID NOW performance stood out as significantly worse than the other three assays despite demonstrating comparable analytic sensitivity.

OBJECTIVES: The COVID-19 pandemic has obligated physicians to recur to additional resources and make drastic changes regarding the standard physician-patient encounter. In the last century, there has been a substantial improvement in technology, which over the years has opened the door to a new form of medical practicing known as telemedicine. METHODS: Healthcare workers from three hospitals involved in the care for COVID-19 patients in the united states were invited to share their experience using telemedicine to deliver clinical care to their patients. RESULTS: Since the appearance of this worldwide outbreak, social distancing has been a key factor in preventing the spread of the virus, for which measures have been taken to limit physical contact. Because of the ongoing situation, telemedicine has been progressively incorporated into the physician-patient encounters and quickly has become an essential component in the day-today medical practice. CONCLUSIONS: It is feasible to deliver viable spine practice with the use of telemedicine. A proper patient selection of patients requiring virtual treatment versus those requiring in-person visits should be considered.",,Global Spine Journal,,,2020-06-03,2020,,,2192568220932168,All OA; Gold,Article,"Franco, Daniel; Montenegro, Thiago; Gonzalez, Glenn A; Hines, Kevin; Mahtabfar, Aria; Helgeson, Melvin D; Patel, Rakesh; Harrop, James","Franco, Daniel (Thomas Jefferson University Hospital, Philadelphia, PA, USA.); Montenegro, Thiago (Thomas Jefferson University Hospital, Philadelphia, PA, USA.); Gonzalez, Glenn A (Thomas Jefferson University Hospital, Philadelphia, PA, USA.); Hines, Kevin (Thomas Jefferson University Hospital, Philadelphia, PA, USA.); Mahtabfar, Aria (Thomas Jefferson University Hospital, Philadelphia, PA, USA.); Helgeson, Melvin D (Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, Bethesda, MD, USA.); Patel, Rakesh (University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.); Harrop, James (Thomas Jefferson University Hospital, Philadelphia, PA, USA.)",,"Franco, Daniel (Thomas Jefferson University Hospital); Montenegro, Thiago (Thomas Jefferson University Hospital); Gonzalez, Glenn A (Thomas Jefferson University Hospital); Hines, Kevin (Thomas Jefferson University Hospital); Mahtabfar, Aria (Thomas Jefferson University Hospital); Helgeson, Melvin D (Walter Reed National Military Medical Center); Patel, Rakesh (University of Michigan); Harrop, James (Thomas Jefferson University Hospital)",Walter Reed National Military Medical Center; Thomas Jefferson University Hospital; University of Michigan,grid.414467.4; grid.412726.4; grid.214458.e,United States; United States; United States,,1,1,,,3,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/2192568220932168,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1128203709,11 Medical and Health Sciences; 1103 Clinical Sciences,

This presentation is consistent with cytokine release syndrome in chimeric antigen receptor T cell therapy, for which IL-6 blockade is approved treatment. Methods: We assessed effectiveness and safety of IL-6 blockade with tocilizumab in a single-center cohort of patients with COVID-19 requiring mechanical ventilation. The primary endpoint was survival probability post-intubation; secondary analyses included an ordinal illness severity scale integrating superinfections. Outcomes in patients who received tocilizumab compared to tocilizumab-untreated controls were evaluated using multivariable Cox regression with propensity score inverse probability weighting (IPTW). Findings: 154 patients were included, of whom 78 received tocilizumab and 76 did not. Median follow-up was 47 days (range 28-67). Baseline characteristics were similar between groups, although tocilizumab-treated patients were younger (mean 55 vs. 60 years), less likely to have chronic pulmonary disease (10% vs. 28%), and had lower D-dimer values at time of intubation (median 2.4 vs. 6.5 mg/dL). In IPTW-adjusted models, tocilizumab was associated with a 45% reduction in hazard of death [hazard ratio 0.55 (95% CI 0.33, 0.90)] and improved status on the ordinal outcome scale [odds ratio per 1-level increase: 0.59 (0.36, 0.95)]. Though tocilizumab was associated with an increased proportion of patients with superinfections (54% vs. 26%; p<0.001), there was no difference in 28-day case fatality rate among tocilizumab-treated patients with versus without superinfection [22% vs. 15%; p=0.42]. Interpretation: In this cohort of mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients, tocilizumab was associated with a decreased likelihood of death despite higher superinfection occurrence. Randomized controlled trials are urgently needed to confirm these findings.","ACKNOWLEDGMENTS This work was supported by the National Institutes of Health (NIH/NCATS UL1TR002240; NIH/NHLBI 1K12HL133304 to CMF); the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC U01IP000974); and an ASTCT New Investigator Award (to JLG).

All forms of future EU-UK relationship are worse for health than EU membership, but analysis of the negotiating texts shows some forms are better than others. The likely outcomes involve major negative effects for NHS staffing, funding for health and social care, and capital financing for the NHS; and for UK global leadership and influence. We expect minor negative effects for cross border healthcare (except in Northern Ireland); research collaboration; and data sharing, such as the Early Warning and Response System for health threats. Despite political narratives, the legal texts show that the UK seeks de facto continuity in selected key areas for pharmaceuticals, medical devices, and equipment [including personal protective equipment (PPE)], especially clinical trials, pharmacovigilance, and batch-testing. The UK will be excluded from economies of scale of EU membership, e.g. joint procurement programmes as used recently for PPE. Above all, there is a major risk of reaching an agreement with significant adverse effects for health, without meaningful oversight by or input from the UK Parliament, or other health policy stakeholders.","Acknowledgements: The support of the ESRC Governance after Brexit grant ES/S00730X/1 and the NIHR Oxford Biomedical Research Centre are gratefully acknowledged.",Health Economics Policy and Law,,,2020-06-03,2020,,,1-18,All OA; Gold,Article,"Fahy, Nick; Hervey, Tamara; Dayan, Mark; Flear, Mark; Galsworthy, Mike; Greer, Scott; Jarman, Holly; McKee, Martin","Fahy, Nick (Nuffield Department of Primary Care/Green Templeton College, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.); Hervey, Tamara (School of Law, University of Sheffield, Sheffield, UK.); Dayan, Mark (Nuffield Trust, London, UK.); Flear, Mark (School of Law, Queen's University Belfast, Belfast, UK.); Galsworthy, Mike (Scientists for EU, UK.); Greer, Scott (School of Public Health, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, USA.); Jarman, Holly (School of Public Health, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, USA.); McKee, Martin (London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London, UK.)",,"Fahy, Nick (University of Oxford); Hervey, Tamara (University of Sheffield); Dayan, Mark (Nuffield Trust); Flear, Mark (Queen's University Belfast); Galsworthy, Mike (); Greer, Scott (University of Michigan); Jarman, Holly (University of Michigan); McKee, Martin (London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine)",University of Sheffield; Nuffield Trust; University of Michigan; Queen's University Belfast; London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine; University of Oxford,grid.11835.3e; grid.475979.1; grid.214458.e; grid.4777.3; grid.8991.9; grid.4991.5,United Kingdom; United Kingdom; United States; United Kingdom; United Kingdom; United Kingdom,Economic and Social Research Council,2,2,,,31,https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/7AF3CFD41CDCBDCD7FE528EC481DBF0F/S1744133120000171a.pdf/div-class-title-assessing-the-potential-impact-on-health-of-the-uk-s-future-relationship-agreement-with-the-eu-analysis-of-the-negotiating-positions-div.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1128171281,1801 Law; 14 Economics; 16 Studies in Human Society; 18 Law and Legal Studies; 1605 Policy and Administration; 1402 Applied Economics,3 Good Health and Well Being

There is no published peer-reviewed data regarding the dose required to effectively disinfect SARS-CoV-2 on N95 filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs). Four different locations (facepiece and strap) on 5 different N95 FFR models (3M 1860, 8210, 8511, 9211; Moldex 1511) were inoculated with a 10 μL drop of SARS-CoV-2 viral stock (8 x 107 TCID50/mL). The outside-facing and wearer-facing surfaces of the respirators were each irradiated with a dose of 1.5 J/cm2 UVC (254 nm). Viable SARS-CoV-2 was quantified by a median tissue culture infectious dose assay (TCID50). UVC delivered using a dose of 1.5 J/cm2, to each side, was an effective method of decontamination for the facepieces of 3M 1860 and Moldex 1511, and for the straps of 3M 8210 and the Moldex 1511. This dose is an appropriate decontamination method to facilitate reuse of respirators for healthcare personnel when applied to certain models/materials. Increasing the dose may improve decontamination for the other models and straps; however, UVC radiation can degrade certain polymers in a dose dependent manner, and the effects may vary greatly between different models. Therefore, fit-testing of UVC decontaminated respirators must be performed each time a new model and/or dose is introduced into the healthcare system.",,medRxiv,,,2020-06-02,2020,,,2020.05.31.20118588,"All OA; Green, Published",Preprint,"Ozog, David M.; Sexton, Jonathan Z.; Narla, Shanthi; Pretto-Kernahan, Carla D.; Mirabelli, Carmen; Lim, Henry W.; Hamzavi, Iltefat H.; Tibbetts, Robert J.; Mi, Qing-Sheng","Ozog, David M.

The objective of this study was to understand the early effects of the COVID-19 pandemic among low-income adults in the US as social distancing measures began to be implemented. On 19-24 March 2020 we fielded a national, web-based survey (53% response rate) among adults with <250% of the federal poverty line in the US (N = 1478). Measures included household food security status and COVID-19-related basic needs challenges. Overall, 36% of low-income adults in the US were food secure, 20% had marginal food security, and 44% were food insecure. Less than one in five (18.8%) of adults with very low food security reported being able to comply with public health recommendations to purchase two weeks of food at a time. For every basic needs challenge, food-insecure adults were significantly more likely to report facing that challenge, with a clear gradient effect based on severity of food security. The short-term effects of the COVID-19 pandemic are magnifying existing disparities and disproportionately affecting low-income, food-insecure households that already struggle to meet basic needs.

Physicians and health care workers are at added risk of exposure and infection during the course of patient care. Because of the rapid spread of this disease through respiratory droplets, health care workers who come in close contact with the upper aerodigestive tract during diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, such as otolaryngologists-head and neck surgeons, are particularly at risk. A set of safety recommendations was created based on a review of the literature and communications with physicians with firsthand knowledge of safety procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic. Observations: A high number of health care workers were infected during the first phase of the pandemic in the city of Wuhan, China. Subsequently, by adopting strict safety precautions, other regions were able to achieve high levels of safety for health care workers without jeopardizing the care of patients. The most common procedures related to the examination and treatment of upper aerodigestive tract diseases were reviewed. Each category was reviewed based on the potential risk imposed to health care workers. Specific recommendations were made based on the literature, when available, or consensus best practices. Specific safety recommendations were made for performing tracheostomy in patients with COVID-19. Conclusions and Relevance: Preserving a highly skilled health care workforce is a top priority for any community and health care system. Based on the experience of health care systems in Asia and Europe, by following strict safety guidelines, the risk of exposure and infection of health care workers could be greatly reduced while providing high levels of care. The provided recommendations, which may evolve over time, could be used as broad guidance for all health care workers who are involved in the care of patients with COVID-19.",,JAMA Otolaryngology - Head & Neck Surgery,,"Betacoronavirus; Comorbidity; Consensus; Coronavirus Infections; Disease Transmission, Infectious; Humans; Otolaryngology; Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases; Otorhinolaryngologic Surgical Procedures; Pandemics; Patient Care; Pneumonia, Viral",2020-06-01,2020,146,6,579-584,All OA; Gold,Article,"Givi, Babak; Schiff, Bradley A.; Chinn, Steven B.; Clayburgh, Daniel; Iyer, N.

High-quality respiratory protection is essential to reduce exposure among healthcare workers, yet dire shortages of personal protective equipment in the United States threaten the health and safety of this essential workforce. In the context of rapidly changing conditions and incomplete data, this article outlines 3 important strategies to improve healthcare workers' respiratory protection. At a minimum, healthcare workers delivering care to patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 should wear N95 respirators and full-face shields. Several mechanisms exist to boost and protect the supply of N95 respirators, including rigorous decontamination protocols, invoking the Defense Production Act, expanded use of reusable elastomeric respirators, and repurposing industrial N95 respirators. Finally, homemade facial coverings do not protect healthcare workers and should be avoided. These strategies, coupled with longer-term strategies of investments in protective equipment research, infrastructure, and data systems, provide a framework to protect healthcare workers immediately and enhance preparedness efforts for future pandemics.",,Health Security,,"Communicable Disease Control; Coronavirus Infections; Delivery of Health Care; Female; Health Personnel; Humans; Infectious Disease Transmission, Patient-to-Professional; Male; Occupational Exposure; Occupational Health; Pandemics; Patient Safety; Personal Protective Equipment; Pneumonia, Viral; United States",2020-06-01,2020,18,3,237-240,All OA; Gold,Article,"Friese, Christopher R.; Veenema, Tener Goodwin; Johnson, James S.; Jayaraman, Sundaresan; Chang, James C.; Clever, Linda Hawes","Friese, Christopher R.

In this Perspective, autopsy results and literature are presented supporting the hypothesis that a little known yet powerful function of neutrophils-the ability to form neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs)-may contribute to organ damage and mortality in COVID-19. We show lung infiltration of neutrophils in an autopsy specimen from a patient who succumbed to COVID-19. We discuss prior reports linking aberrant NET formation to pulmonary diseases, thrombosis, mucous secretions in the airways, and cytokine production. If our hypothesis is correct, targeting NETs directly and/or indirectly with existing drugs may reduce the clinical severity of COVID-19.","The authors, members of “The NETwork to Target Neutrophils in COVID-19,” thank Andrew Whiteley for organizing the discussions that are summarized in this paper; Laura Maiorino for generating the illustrations; Laura Maiorino and Stephen Hearn for the photomicrograph of NETs; and Bruce Stillman and David Tuveson for discussions and critical review of the manuscript.

The White House and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have published guidelines to assist US states, counties, and territories in planning these efforts. As the impact of the coronavirus pandemic has not been uniform, these central guidelines need to be translated into practice in ways that recognize variation among jurisdictions. We present a core methodology to assist governments in this task, presenting a case for appropriate actions at each stage of recovery based on scientific data and analysis. Specifically, 3 types of data are needed: data on the spread of disease should be analyzed alongside data on the overall health of the population and data on infrastructure-for example, the capacity of health systems. Local circumstances will produce different needs and present different setbacks, and governments may need to reinstate as well as relax restrictions. Transparent, defensible analysis can assist in making these decisions and communicating them to the public. In the absence of a widely administered vaccine, analysis remains one of our most important tools in addressing the coronavirus pandemic.",The authors thank George Siharulidze for his design assistance for both figures.,Health Security,,"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, U.S.; Communicable Disease Control; Coronavirus Infections; Female; Humans; Male; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Practice Guidelines as Topic; Public Health; Quarantine; United States",2020-06-01,2020,18,3,250-256,Closed,Article,"Trump, Benjamin D.; Bridges, Todd S.; Cegan, Jeffrey C.; Cibulsky, Susan M.; Greer, Scott L.; Jarman, Holly; Lafferty, Brandon J.; Surette, Melissa A.; Linkov, Igor","Trump, Benjamin D.

The unique needs of neonates and children, and their role in the spread of the virus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2]) should be included in preparedness and response plans. Fetuses and newborn infants may be uniquely vulnerable to the damaging consequences of congenitally- or perinatally-acquired SARS-CoV-2 infection, but data are limited about outcomes of COVID-19 disease during pregnancy. Therefore, information on illnesses associated with other highly pathogenic coronaviruses (i.e., severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome [MERS]), as well as comparisons to common congenital infections, such as cytomegalovirus (CMV), are warranted. Research regarding the potential routes of acquisition of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the prenatal and perinatal setting is of a high public health priority.

Patients with a compromised immune system are expected to be more susceptible to a severe disease course. In this report we suggest that patients with systemic lupus erythematous might be especially prone to severe COVID-19 independent of their immunosuppressed state from lupus treatment. Specifically, we provide evidence in lupus to suggest hypomethylation and overexpression of ACE2, which is located on the X chromosome and encodes a functional receptor for the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein. Oxidative stress induced by viral infections exacerbates the DNA methylation defect in lupus, possibly resulting in further ACE2 hypomethylation and enhanced viremia. In addition, demethylation of interferon-regulated genes, NFκB, and key cytokine genes in lupus patients might exacerbate the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 and increase the likelihood of cytokine storm. These arguments suggest that inherent epigenetic dysregulation in lupus might facilitate viral entry, viremia, and an excessive immune response to SARS-CoV-2. Further, maintaining disease remission in lupus patients is critical to prevent a vicious cycle of demethylation and increased oxidative stress, which will exacerbate susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection during the current pandemic. Epigenetic control of the ACE2 gene might be a target for prevention and therapy in COVID-19.",,Clinical Immunology,,"Betacoronavirus; CD11a Antigen; Coronavirus Infections; Cytokines; DNA Methylation; Disease Progression; Epigenesis, Genetic; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Host-Pathogen Interactions; Humans; Interferon Regulatory Factors; Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic; NF-kappa B; Oxidative Stress; Pandemics; Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A; Pneumonia, Viral; Protein Binding; Receptors, KIR; Signal Transduction; Spike Glycoprotein, Coronavirus; Viremia",2020-06,2020,215,,108410,"All OA; Green, Published",Article,"Sawalha, Amr H.; Zhao, Ming; Coit, Patrick; Lu, Qianjin","Sawalha, Amr H.

It was declared by the WHO as a public health emergency. The most susceptible populations, needing mechanical ventilation, are the elderly and people with associated comorbidities. There is an important risk of contagion for anesthetists, dentists, head and neck surgeons, maxillofacial surgeons, ophthalmologists, and otolaryngologists. Health workers represent between 3.8% and 20% of the infected population; some 15% will develop severe complaints and among them, many will lose their lives. A large number of patients do not have overt signs and symptoms (fever/respiratory), yet pose a real risk to surgeons (who should know this fact and must therefore apply respiratory protective strategies for all patients they encounter). All interventions that have the potential to aerosolize aerodigestive secretions should be avoided or used only when mandatory. Health workers who are: pregnant, over 55 to 65 years of age, with a history of chronic diseases (uncontrolled hypertension, diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, and all clinical scenarios where immunosuppression is feasible, including that induced to treat chronic inflammatory conditions and organ transplants) should avoid the clinical attention of a potentially infected patient. Health care facilities should prioritize urgent and emergency visits and procedures until the present condition stabilizes; truly elective care should cease and discussed on a case-by-case basis for patients with cancer. For those who are working with COVID-19 infected patients' isolation is compulsory in the following settings: (a) unprotected close contact with COVID-19 pneumonia patients; (b) onset of fever, cough, shortness of breath, and other symptoms (gastrointestinal complaints, anosmia, and dysgeusia have been reported in a minority of cases). For any care or intervention in the upper aerodigestive tract region, irrespective of the setting and a confirmed diagnosis (eg, rhinoscopy or flexible laryngoscopy in the outpatient setting and tracheostomy or rigid endoscopy under anesthesia), it is strongly recommended that all health care personnel wear personal protective equipment such as N95, gown, cap, eye protection, and gloves. The procedures described are essential in trying to maintain safety of health care workers during COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, otolaryngologists, head and neck, and maxillofacial surgeons are per se exposed to the greatest risk of infection while caring for COVID-19 positive subjects, and their protection should be considered a priority in the present circumstances.",,Head & Neck,,"Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Infectious Disease Transmission, Patient-to-Professional; Otolaryngology; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Practice Guidelines as Topic; Practice Patterns, Physicians'",2020-06,2020,42,6,1259-1267,All OA; Gold,Article,"Kowalski, Luiz P.; Sanabria, Alvaro; Ridge, John A.; Ng, Wai Tong; Bree, Remco; Rinaldo, Alessandra; Takes, Robert P.; Mäkitie, Antti A.; Carvalho, Andre L.; Bradford, Carol R.; Paleri, Vinidh; Hartl, Dana M.; Poorten, Vincent Vander; Nixon, Iain J.; Piazza, Cesare; Lacy, Peter D.; Rodrigo, Juan P.; Guntinas‐Lichius, Orlando; Mendenhall, William M.; D'Cruz, Anil; Lee, Anne W.

Clinical characteristics and outcomes among patients with orthotopic heart transplant (OHT) with COVID-19 remain poorly described. METHODS: We performed a retrospective case series of patients with OHT with COVID-19 admitted to 1 of 2 hospitals in Southeastern Michigan between March 21 and April 22, 2020. Clinical data were obtained through review of the electronic medical record. Final date of follow-up was May 7, 2020. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiologic, treatment, and mortality data were collected and analyzed. RESULTS: We identified 13 patients with OHT admitted with COVID-19. The mean age of patients was 61 ± 12 years, 100% were black males, and symptoms began 6 ± 4 days before admission. The most common symptoms included subjective fever (92%), shortness of breath (85%), and cough (77%). Six patients (46%) required admission to the intensive care unit. Two patients (15%) died during hospitalization. CONCLUSIONS: Black men may be at increased risk for COVID-19 among patients with OHT. Presenting signs and symptoms in this cohort are similar to those in the general population. Elevated inflammatory markers on presentation appear to be associated with more severe illness.",,Journal of Cardiac Failure,,"Adult; Aged; Betacoronavirus; Cohort Studies; Coronavirus Infections; Critical Care; Female; Heart Failure; Heart Transplantation; Hospitalization; Humans; Male; Michigan; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral",2020-06,2020,26,6,457-461,All OA; Gold,Article,"Ketcham, Scott W.; Adie, Sarah K.; Malliett, Ashley; Abdul-Aziz, Ahmad A.; Bitar, Abbas; Grafton, Gillian; Konerman, Matthew C.","Ketcham, Scott W.

Otolaryngologists have a special role in responding to this crisis by virtue of expertise in airway management. Against the backdrop of nations struggling to contain the virus's spread and to manage hospital strain, otolaryngologists must partner with anesthesiologists and front-line health care teams to provide expert services in high-risk situations while reducing transmission. Airway management and airway endoscopy, whether awake or sedated, expose operators to infectious aerosols, posing risks to staff. This commentary provides background on the outbreak, highlights critical considerations around mitigating infectious aerosol contact, and outlines best practices for airway-related clinical decision making during the COVID-19 pandemic. What otolaryngologists need to know and what actions are required are considered alongside the implications of increasing demand for tracheostomy. Approaches to managing the airway are presented, emphasizing safety of patients and the health care team.","We thank Stephen Warrillow, MBBS, FRACP, FCICM, Austin Health, Melbourne, Australia, and immediate past president of the Australian and New Zealand Intensive Care Society, for input on this manuscript and Stephanie King at University of Michigan for assistance with graphic design for Figure 1.

Concurrently, concerns about potential shortages of healthcare professionals and health supplies to address these issues have focused attention on how these resources are ultimately allocated and used. Some strategies, for example, misguidedly use age as an arbitrary criterion that disfavors older adults in resource allocation decisions. This is a companion article to the American Geriatrics Society (AGS) position statement, ""Resource Allocation Strategies and Age-Related Considerations in the COVID-19 Era and Beyond."" It is intended to inform stakeholders including hospitals, health systems, and policymakers about ethical considerations that should be considered when developing strategies for allocation of scarce resources during an emergency involving older adults. This review presents the legal and ethical background for the position statement and discusses these issues that informed the development of the AGS positions: (1) age as a determining factor, (2) age as a tiebreaker, (3) criteria with a differential impact on older adults, (4) individual choices and advance directives, (5) racial/ethnic disparities and resource allocation, and (6) scoring systems and their impact on older adults. It also considers the role of advance directives as expressions of individual preferences in pandemics.

Community health workers are poised to play a pivotal role in fighting the pandemic, especially in countries with less resilient health systems. Drawing from practitioner expertise across four WHO regions, this article outlines the targeted actions needed at different stages of the pandemic to achieve the following goals: (1) PROTECT healthcare workers, (2) INTERRUPT the virus, (3) MAINTAIN existing healthcare services while surging their capacity, and (4) SHIELD the most vulnerable from socioeconomic shocks. While decisive action must be taken now to blunt the impact of the pandemic in countries likely to be hit the hardest, many of the investments in the supply chain, compensation, dedicated supervision, continuous training and performance management necessary for rapid community response in a pandemic are the same as those required to achieve universal healthcare and prevent the next epidemic.",,BMJ Global Health,,"Community Health Workers;

13,pub.1127404405,10.1111/jgs.16537,32374440,PMC7267615,AGS Position Statement: Resource Allocation Strategies and Age‐Related Considerations in the COVID‐19 Era and Beyond,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) continues to impact older adults disproportionately, from severe illness and hospitalization to increased mortality risk. Concurrently, concerns about potential shortages of healthcare professionals and health supplies to address these needs have focused attention on how resources are ultimately allocated and used. Some strategies misguidedly use age as an arbitrary criterion, inappropriately disfavoring older adults. This statement represents the official policy position of the American Geriatrics Society (AGS). It is intended to inform stakeholders including hospitals, health systems, and policymakers about ethical considerations to consider when developing strategies for allocating scarce resources during an emergency involving older adults. Members of the AGS Ethics Committee collaborated with interprofessional experts in ethics, law, nursing, and medicine (including geriatrics, palliative care, emergency medicine, and pulmonology/critical care) to conduct a structured literature review and examine relevant reports. The resulting recommendations defend a particular view of distributive justice that maximizes relevant clinical factors and deemphasizes or eliminates factors placing arbitrary, disproportionate weight on advanced age. The AGS positions include (1) avoiding age per se as a means for excluding anyone from care; (2) assessing comorbidities and considering the disparate impact of social determinants of health; (3) encouraging decision makers to focus primarily on potential short-term (not long-term) outcomes; (4) avoiding ancillary criteria such as ""life-years saved"" and ""long-term predicted life expectancy"" that might disadvantage older people; (5) forming and staffing triage committees tasked with allocating scarce resources; (6) developing institutional resource allocation strategies that are transparent and applied uniformly; and (7) facilitating appropriate advance care planning. The statement includes recommendations that should be immediately implemented to address resource allocation strategies during COVID-19, aligning with AGS positions. The statement also includes recommendations for post-pandemic review. Such review would support revised strategies to ensure that governments and institutions have equitable emergency resource allocation strategies, avoid future discriminatory language and practice, and have appropriate guidance to develop national frameworks for emergent resource allocation decisions.

We examine an ensemble of public health metrics to assess the control of COVID-19 epidemic in women-versus men-led countries worldwide based on data available up to June 3. The median of the distribution of median time-varying effective reproduction number for women- and men-led countries were 0.89 and 1.14 respectively with the 95% two-sample bootstrap-based confidence interval for the difference (women - men) being [-0.34, 0.02]. In terms of scale of testing, the median percentage of population tested were 3.28% (women), 1.59% (men) [95% CI: (-1.29%, 3.60%)] with test positive rates of 2.69% (women) and 4.94% (men) respectively.

This approach ignores how systems interact and how their systemic properties shape socioeconomic outcomes, leading to an over-emphasis on a limited set of characteristics, notably efficiency. We argue that this emphasis on efficiency in the operation, management and outcomes of various economic and social systems is not a conscious collective choice, but rather the response of the whole system to the incentives that individual components face. This has brought much of the world to rely upon complex, nested, and interconnected systems to deliver goods and services around the globe. While this approach has many benefits, the Covid-19 crisis shows how it has also reduced the resilience of key systems to shocks, and allowed failures to cascade from one system to others. This paper reviews the impact of COVID-19 on socioeconomic systems, discusses the notion of resilience, and provides specific recommendations on both integrating resilience analytics for recovery from the current crisis as well as on building resilient infrastructure to address future systemic challenges.",,Environment Systems and Decisions,,,2020-06,2020,40,2,174-184,All OA; Gold,Article,"Hynes, William; Trump, Benjamin; Love, Patrick; Linkov, Igor","Hynes, William (New Approaches to Economic Challenges Unit, Office of the Secretary General, OECD, 2 rue Andre Pascal, 75775, Paris, France); Trump, Benjamin (New Approaches to Economic Challenges Unit, Office of the Secretary General, OECD, 2 rue Andre Pascal, 75775, Paris, France; University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA); Love, Patrick (New Approaches to Economic Challenges Unit, Office of the Secretary General, OECD, 2 rue Andre Pascal, 75775, Paris, France); Linkov, Igor (New Approaches to Economic Challenges Unit, Office of the Secretary General, OECD, 2 rue Andre Pascal, 75775, Paris, France; Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA)","Linkov, Igor (Organisation For Economic Co-Operation and Development; Carnegie Mellon University)","Hynes, William (Organisation For Economic Co-Operation and Development); Trump, Benjamin (Organisation For Economic Co-Operation and Development; University of Michigan); Love, Patrick (Organisation For Economic Co-Operation and Development); Linkov, Igor (Organisation For Economic Co-Operation and Development; Carnegie Mellon University)",University of Michigan; Organisation For Economic Co-Operation and Development; Carnegie Mellon University,grid.214458.e; grid.36193.3e; grid.147455.6,United States; France; United States,,10,10,,,63,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10669-020-09776-x.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1127864480,1402 Applied Economics; 14 Economics,11 Sustainable Cities and Communities

We also consider the contributions of the convoy model to the field of family gerontology by illustrating concepts, methods, and measures used to test the model, as well as its usefulness and limitations in addressing contemporary issues facing older adults. Finally, we discuss opportunities for innovation and application of the convoy model to the study of later-life family relationships. In summary, we emphasize the benefits and inclusiveness of the convoy model for guiding current and future research to address challenges facing family gerontology now and in the future.",,Journal of Family Theory & Review,,,2020-06,2020,12,2,126-146,All OA; Gold,Article,"Fuller, Heather R.; Ajrouch, Kristine J.; Antonucci, Toni C.","Fuller, Heather R.

The pneumonia detection is usually performed through examine of chest X-Ray radiograph by highly-trained specialists. This process is tedious and often leads to a disagreement between radiologists. Computer-aided diagnosis systems showed the potential for improving diagnostic accuracy. In this work, we develop the computational approach for pneumonia regions detection based on single-shot detectors, squeeze-and-extinction deep convolution neural networks, augmentations and multi-task learning. The proposed approach was evaluated in the context of the Radiological Society of North America Pneumonia Detection Challenge, achieving one of the best results in the challenge.","We thank the National Institutes for Health Clinical Center for providing the chest x-ray images used in the competition, Kaggle, Inc. for hosting the challenge.

There is an urgent need to train radiation oncologists and medical physicists in data science to help shepherd AI solutions into clinical practice. Poorly trained personnel may do more harm than good when attempting to apply rapidly developing and complex technologies. As the amount of AI research expands in our field, the radiation oncology community needs to discuss how to educate future generations in this area. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The National Cancer Institute (NCI) Workshop on AI in Radiation Oncology (Shady Grove, MD, April 4-5, 2019) was the first of 2 data science workshops in radiation oncology hosted by the NCI in 2019. During this workshop, the Training and Education Working Group was formed by volunteers among the invited attendees. Its members represent radiation oncology, medical physics, radiology, computer science, industry, and the NCI. RESULTS: In this perspective article written by members of the Training and Education Working Group, we provide and discuss action points relevant for future trainees interested in radiation oncology AI: (1) creating AI awareness and responsible conduct; (2) implementing a practical didactic curriculum; (3) creating a publicly available database of training resources; and (4) accelerating learning and funding opportunities.

This study determined whether environmental exposures derived from GigaPan® images could serve as valid predictors of body mass index (BMI), walking and moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) in a longitudinal study of low-income adults living in two primarily African American neighborhoods in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA. GigaPan® is a robotic system used to obtain high-resolution, panoramic images of environments. Methods: Microscale environmental features along 481 streets were audited in 2015-2016 using an audit form. Environmental exposures were estimated for 731 adult participants, using a sample of street segments within a 0.4 km (0.25 mile) network distance from each participant's residential address. Summary environmental exposures were constructed using factor analysis. We tested associations between participant-level environmental exposures and objectively measured BMI, self-reported walking and objectively measured MVPA in regression models controlling for baseline health and demographic variables. Results: Three factors representing participants' environmental exposures were constructed: pedestrian bicycle-amenities; hilly-vacant-boarded; physical activity-recreation/low housing density. Environments with infrastructure and amenities supportive of walking and bicycling were associated with lower BMI (Coef. = ‒0.47, p = 0.02). Frequent walking was less likely in environments with more physical activity and recreation venues/low housing density (OR = 0.81, 95% CI [0.67, 0.96]). MVPA was not associated with any of the environmental measures and the hilly-vacant-boarded factor was not associated with any of the outcomes. Conclusions: Predictive validity was demonstrated for an environmental exposure factor that captured features supportive of walking and cycling in a model predicting BMI, using built environment audit data from GigaPan® imagery. A complementary analysis found lower odds of frequent walking in the neighborhood among participants with exposure to more physical activity and recreational features, but fewer types and lower density of housing.","This work was supported by grants from the National Cancer Institute (NCI), National Institutes of Health, Department of Health and Human Services (R21 CA188481, Natalie Colabianchi, PI and R01 CA164137, Tamara Dubowitz, PI).

We show large disparities across race-ethnicity and socioeconomic status in the prevalence of conditions, including hypertension, which are associated with the risk of severe complications from COVID-19. Moreover, we show that these disparities emerge early in life, prior to age 65, leading to higher vulnerability to such complications.

The reality is that the U.S. is ill equipped to realize health equity in prevention and control efforts for any type of health outcome, including an infectious disease pandemic. In this article, we address an important question: When new waves of the current pandemic emerge or another novel pandemic emerges, how can the U.S. be better prepared and also ensure a rapid response that reduces rather than exacerbates social and health inequities?

Pharmacy staff are responsible for transcribing these directions so that patients can take their medication as prescribed. However, little is known about the quality of these transcribed directions received by patients. METHODS: A retrospective observational analysis of 529 990 e-prescription directions processed at a mail-order pharmacy in the USA. We measured pharmacy staff editing of directions using string edit distance and execution time using the Keystroke-Level Model. Using the New Dale-Chall (NDC) readability formula, we calculated NDC cloze scores of the patient directions before and after transcription. We also evaluated the quality of directions (eg, included a dose, dose unit, frequency of administration) before and after transcription with a random sample of 966 patient directions. RESULTS: Pharmacy staff edited 83.8% of all e-prescription directions received with a median edit distance of 18 per e-prescription. We estimated a median of 6.64 s of transcribing each e-prescription. The median NDC score increased by 68.6% after transcription (26.12 vs 44.03, p<0.001), which indicated a significant readability improvement. In our sample, 51.4% of patient directions on e-prescriptions contained at least one pre-defined direction quality issue. Pharmacy staff corrected 79.5% of the quality issues. CONCLUSION: Pharmacy staff put significant effort into transcribing e-prescription directions. Manual transcription removed the majority of quality issues; however, pharmacy staff still miss or introduce following their manual transcription processes. The development of tools and techniques such as a comprehensive set of structured direction components or machine learning-based natural language processing techniques may help produce clear directions.",,BMJ Quality & Safety,,,2020-05-25,2020,,,bmjqs-2019-010405,All OA; Gold,Article,"Zheng, Yifan; Jiang, Yun; Dorsch, Michael P; Ding, Yuting; Vydiswaran, V G Vinod; Lester, Corey A","Zheng, Yifan (Department of Clinical Pharmacy, University of Michigan College of Pharmacy, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA); Jiang, Yun (Department of Systems, Populations and Leadership, University of Michigan School of Nursing, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA); Dorsch, Michael P (Department of Clinical Pharmacy, University of Michigan College of Pharmacy, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA); Ding, Yuting (Department of Clinical Pharmacy, University of Michigan College of Pharmacy, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA); Vydiswaran, V G Vinod (Department of Learning Health Sciences, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA); Lester, Corey A (Department of Clinical Pharmacy, University of Michigan College of Pharmacy, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA)","Lester, Corey A (University of Michigan)","Zheng, Yifan (University of Michigan); Jiang, Yun (University of Michigan); Dorsch, Michael P (University of Michigan); Ding, Yuting (University of Michigan); Vydiswaran, V G Vinod (University of Michigan); Lester, Corey A (University of Michigan)",University of Michigan,grid.214458.e,United States,,1,1,,,66,https://qualitysafety.bmj.com/content/qhc/early/2020/05/24/bmjqs-2019-010405.full.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1127872903,11 Medical and Health Sciences; 13 Education; 1117 Public Health and Health Services; 1103 Clinical Sciences; 1302 Curriculum and Pedagogy,

The aim of this study was to assess the prognostic value of baseline clinical and high resolution CT (HRCT) findings in patients with severe COVID-19.Methods In this retrospective, two-center study, we included two groups of inpatients with severe COVID-19 who had been discharged or had died in Jin Yin-tan hospital and Wuhan union hospital between January 5, 2020, and February 22, 2020. Cases were confirmed by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Demographic, clinical, laboratory data, and HRCT data were collected and compared between discharged and deceased patients. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression models were used to assess predictors of mortality risk in these patients.Results 101 patients were included in this study, of whom 66 were discharged and 35 died in the hospital. The mean age was 56.6 ± 15.1 years and 67 (66.3%)were men. Of the 101 patients, hypertension (38, 37.6%), cardiovascular disease (21,20.8%), diabetes (18,17.8%), and chronic pulmonary disease (16,15.8%) were the most common coexisting conditions. The multivariable regression analysis showed older age (OR:1.142, 95%CI:1.059–1.231, p༜0.001), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (OR:10.142, 95%CI:1.611–63.853, p = 0.014), reduced lymphocyte count (OR:0.004, 95%CI: 0.001–0.306, p = 0.013), and elevated HRCT score (OR:1.276, 95%CI:1.002–1.625, p = 0.049) to be independent predictors of mortality risk on admission in severe COVID-19 patients.Conclusions These initial data indicate that older age, ARDS, lymphocytopenia and elevated HRCT score on admission were strong predictors of mortality risk in severe COVID-19 patients.",,Research Square,,,2020-05-20,2020,,,,"All OA; Green, Published",Preprint,"Cao, Yukun; Han, Xiaoyu; Gu, Jin; Li, Yumin; Liu, Jia; Alwalid, Osamah; Cui, Yue; Zhang, Xin; Zheng, Chuansheng; Fan, Yanqing; Wu, Hanping; Shi, Heshui","Cao, Yukun (Wuhan Union Hospital); Han, Xiaoyu (Wuhan Union Hospital); Gu, Jin (Wuhan Union Hospital); Li, Yumin (Wuhan Union Hospital); Liu, Jia (Wuhan Union Hospital); Alwalid, Osamah (Wuhan Union Hospital); Cui, Yue (Wuhan Union Hospital); Zhang, Xin (Wuhan Union Hospital); Zheng, Chuansheng (Wuhan Union Hospital); Fan, Yanqing (Wuhan Union Hospital); Wu, Hanping (University of Michigan); Shi, Heshui (Wuhan union hospital)",,"Cao, Yukun (Wuhan Union Hospital); Han, Xiaoyu (Wuhan Union Hospital); Gu, Jin (Wuhan Union Hospital); Li, Yumin (Wuhan Union Hospital); Liu, Jia (Wuhan Union Hospital); Alwalid, Osamah (Wuhan Union Hospital); Cui, Yue (Wuhan Union Hospital); Zhang, Xin (Wuhan Union Hospital); Zheng, Chuansheng (Wuhan Union Hospital); Fan, Yanqing (Wuhan Union Hospital); Wu, Hanping (University of Michigan); Shi, Heshui (Wuhan Union Hospital)",Wuhan Union Hospital; University of Michigan,grid.412839.5; grid.214458.e,China; United States,,0,0,,,,https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-27790/v1.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1127758607,1117 Public Health and Health Services; 11 Medical and Health Sciences; 1103 Clinical Sciences,

As of 20 Feb 2020, a total of 2,055 medical staff infected with SARS-Cov-2 in China had been reported. The predominant cause of the infection and the failure of protection among medical staff remains unclear. We sought to explore the epidemiological, clinical characteristics and prognosis of novel coronavirus-infected medical staff.Methods Medical staff who infected with SARS-Cov-2 and admitted to Union Hospital, Wuhan between 16 Jan, 2020 to 25 Feb, 2020 were included retrospectively. Epidemiological, clinical and radiological data were compared by occupation and analyzed with the Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression methods.Results A total of 101 medical staff (32 males and 69 females; median age: 33 years old) were included in this study and 74% were nurses. None had an exposure to Huanan seafood wholesale market or wildlife. A small proportion of the cohort had contact with specimens (3%) as well as patients infected with SARS-Cov-2 in fever clinics (15%) and isolation wards (3%). 80% of medical staff showed abnormal IL-6 levels and 33% had lymphocytopenia. Chest CT mainly manifested as bilateral (62%), septal/subpleural (77%) and ground­glass opacities (48%). The major differences between doctors and nurses manifested in laboratory indicators. As of the last observed date, no patient was transferred to intensive care unit or died, and 98 (97%) had been discharged. Fever (HR=0.57; 95% CI 0.36-0.90) and IL-6 levels greater than >2.9 pg/ml (HR=0.50; 95% CI 0.30-0.86) on admission were unfavorable factors for discharge.Conclusions Our findings suggested that the infection of medical staff mainly occurred at the early stages of SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in Wuhan, and only a small proportion of infection had an exact mode. Meanwhile, medical staff infected with COVID-19 have relatively milder symptoms and favorable clinical course than other ordinary patients, which may be partly due to their medical expertise, younger age and less underlying diseases.

27,pub.1127727864,10.1101/2020.05.18.101485,,,Does the human placenta express the canonical cell entry mediators for SARS-CoV-2?,"ABSTRACT The pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has affected over 3.8 million people, including pregnant women. To date, no consistent evidence of vertical transmission for SARS-CoV-2 exists. This new coronavirus canonically utilizes the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and the serine protease TMPRSS2 for cell entry. Herein, building upon our previous single cell study of the placenta (Pique-Regi, 2019), another study, and new single-cell/nuclei RNA-sequencing data, we investigated the expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 throughout pregnancy as well as in third-trimester chorioamniotic membranes. We report that co-transcription of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 is negligible, thus not a likely path of vertical transmission for SARS-CoV-2 at any stage of pregnancy. In contrast, receptors for Zika virus and cytomegalovirus which cause congenital infections are highly expressed by placental cell types.

COVID-19 results in higher pathogenicity and mortality in the elderly compared to children. Examining baseline SARS-CoV-2 cross-reactive coronavirus immunological responses, induced by circulating human coronaviruses, is critical to understand such divergent clinical outcomes. The cross-reactivity of coronavirus antibody responses of healthy children (n=89), adults (n=98), elderly (n=57), and COVID-19 patients (n=19) were analysed by systems serology. While moderate levels of cross-reactive SARS-CoV-2 IgG, IgM, and IgA were detected in healthy individuals, we identified serological signatures associated with SARS-CoV-2 antigen-specific Fcγ receptor binding, which accurately distinguished COVID-19 patients from healthy individuals and suggested that SARS-CoV-2 induces qualitative changes to antibody Fc upon infection, enhancing Fcγ receptor engagement. Vastly different serological signatures were observed between healthy children and elderly, with markedly higher cross-reactive SARS-CoV-2 IgA and IgG observed in elderly, whereas children displayed elevated SARS-CoV-2 IgM, including receptor binding domain-specific IgM with higher avidity. These results suggest that less-experienced humoral immunity associated with higher IgM, as observed in children, may have the potential to induce more potent antibodies upon SARS-CoV-2 infection. These key insights will inform COVID-19 vaccination strategies, improved serological diagnostics and therapeutics.",,medRxiv,,,2020-05-18,2020,,,2020.05.11.20098459,"All OA; Green, Published",Preprint,"Selva, Kevin J.; van de Sandt, Carolien E.; Lemke, Melissa M.; Lee, Christina Y.; Shoffner, Suzanne K.; Chua, Brendon Y.; Nguyen, Thi H.O.; Rowntree, Louise C.; Hensen, Luca; Koutsakos, Marios; Wong, Chinn Yi; Jackson, David C.; Flanagan, Katie L.; Crowe, Jane; Cheng, Allen C.; Doolan, Denise L.; Amanat, Fatima; Krammer, Florian; Chappell, Keith; Modhiran, Naphak; Watterson, Daniel; Young, Paul; Wines, Bruce; Hogarth, P.

This usage has led to perceptions of efficacy of some interventions that, while receiving media coverage, lack robust evidence. Moving forward, randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs) are necessary to ensure that clinicians can treat patients effectively during this outbreak and the next. To do so, academic medical centers must address two key research issues: (1) how to effectively and efficiently determine which trials have the best chance of benefiting current and future patients, and (2) how to establish a transparent and ethical process for subject recruitment while maintaining research integrity and without overburdening patients or staff.

This article reports the effectiveness of a pulsed xenon ultraviolet (PX-UV) disinfection system in reducing the load of SARS-CoV-2 on hard surfaces and N95 respirators. Chamber slides and N95 respirator material were directly inoculated with SARS-CoV-2 and exposed to different durations of PX-UV disinfection. For hard surfaces, disinfection for 1, 2, and 5 minutes resulted in 3.53 Log10, >4.54 Log10, and >4.12 Log10 reductions in viral load, respectively. For N95 respirators, disinfection for 5 minutes resulted in >4.79 Log10 reduction in viral load. We found that PX-UV significantly reduces SARS-CoV-2 on hard surfaces and N95 respirators. With the potential to rapidly disinfectant environmental surfaces and N95 respirators, PX-UV devices are a promising technology for the reduction of environmental and PPE bioburden and to enhance both HCW and patient safety by reducing the risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2.",,medRxiv,,,2020-05-11,2020,,,2020.05.06.20093658,"All OA; Green, Published",Preprint,"Simmons, Sarah; Carrion, Ricardo; Alfson, Kendra; Staples, Hilary; Jinadatha, Chetan; Jarvis, William; Sampathkumar, Priya; Chemaly, Roy; Khawaja, Fareed; Povroznik, Mark; Jackson, Stephanie; Kaye, Keith; Rodriguez, Robert; Stibich, Mark","Simmons, Sarah (Xenex Disinfection Services, Inc., San Antonio, TX;); Carrion, Ricardo (Department of Virology and Immunology, Texas Biomedical Research Institute, San Antonio, TX;); Alfson, Kendra (Department of Virology and Immunology, Texas Biomedical Research Institute, San Antonio, TX;); Staples, Hilary (Department of Virology and Immunology, Texas Biomedical Research Institute, San Antonio, TX;); Jinadatha, Chetan (Department of Medicine, Central Texas Veterans Healthcare System, Temple, TX, Department of Medicine, College of Medicine, Texas A&M Health Science Center, Bryan, TX;); Jarvis, William (Jason and Jarvis Associates, Hilton Head Island, SC;); Sampathkumar, Priya (Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN;); Chemaly, Roy (Department of Infectious Diseases, Infection Control and Employee Health, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX;); Khawaja, Fareed (Department of Infectious Diseases, Infection Control and Employee Health, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX;); Povroznik, Mark (Department of Quality, WVU Medicine: United Hospital Center, Bridgeport, WV;); Jackson, Stephanie (Department of Quality, HonorHealth, Scottsdale, AZ;); Kaye, Keith (School of Medicine, Department of Infectious Diseases, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI;); Rodriguez, Robert (Department of Emergency Medicine, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA); Stibich, Mark (Xenex Disinfection Services, Inc., San Antonio, TX;)",,"Simmons, Sarah (); Carrion, Ricardo (Texas Biomedical Research Institute); Alfson, Kendra (Texas Biomedical Research Institute); Staples, Hilary (Texas Biomedical Research Institute); Jinadatha, Chetan (); Jarvis, William (); Sampathkumar, Priya (Mayo Clinic); Chemaly, Roy (The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center); Khawaja, Fareed (The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center); Povroznik, Mark (United Hospital Center); Jackson, Stephanie (HonorHealth); Kaye, Keith (University of Michigan); Rodriguez, Robert (University of California, San Francisco); Stibich, Mark ()","University of California, San Francisco; Texas Biomedical Research Institute; HonorHealth; University of Michigan; Mayo Clinic; United Hospital Center; The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center",grid.266102.1; grid.250889.e; grid.477855.c; grid.214458.e; grid.66875.3a; grid.438982.c; grid.240145.6,United States; United States; United States; United States; United States; United States; United States,,1,1,,,35,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2020/05/11/2020.05.06.20093658.full.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1127507004,1117 Public Health and Health Services; 11 Medical and Health Sciences,

Impact of nutrition interventions on the outcomes have been scientifically assessed and reported. The role of nutrition in limiting the infection related morbidity and mortality does not appear to be a debatable question but nutrition interventions do not appear to be an essential part of current COVID-19 management strategies. Given the nature of pandemic and lack of organism-specific evidence, variability in nutrition interventions and lack of nutrition interventions is not unexpected. However, delay in realization of the crucial need of nutrition interventions to limit the immediate and long term outcomes at personal and community level may aggravate health related issues that can have long term impact on quality of life and economy. Due to existing undernutrition and lack of nutrition related awareness and competence, need for timely and appropriate interventions is much more critical for developing countries. This manuscript highlights the need and feasibility of various nutrition interventions to assure optimum quality of life during and after COVID-19 pandemic. Available evidence provides enough guidance for nutrition interventions that are safe and promise to accrue various degrees of benefits with almost no likelihood of harm. Nutrition interventions suggested by author are: 1) population level efforts for promoting better use of existing resources; 2) quicker augmentation of nutrition status of high risk people and non-hospitalized cases by use of supplement and individualized guidance and 3) nutritional support of sever case by timely and adequate enteral and parenteral feeding.",,Pakistan Journal of Medical Sciences,,,2020-05-09,2020,36,COVID19-S4,s85-s89,All OA; Gold,Article,"Hakeem, Rubina; Sheikh, Muhammad Adil","Hakeem, Rubina (Prof. Dr. Rubina Hakeem, Ph.D. (UK) RD (UK).

The Importance of China as a Player in the Global Economy.,"This article describes similarities and differences in the response of governments and the international community to the current 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and the 2014 West African Ebola epidemic. It expresses the opinion that the speed and scale of the response to COVID-19 are affected by the important role that China plays in the global economy. By contrast, insufficient and less timely action was initially undertaken in West African countries during the 2014 Ebola epidemic. It concludes by stating why preparedness for and response to all disease outbreaks, also in countries of lower economic importance, should become a priority in the global health agenda.","Acknowledgment: Publication charges for this article were waived due to the ongoing pandemic of COVID-19.",American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene,,"Africa, Western; Betacoronavirus; China; Coronavirus Infections; Disaster Planning; Disease Outbreaks; Ebolavirus; Global Burden of Disease; Global Health; Hemorrhagic Fever, Ebola; Humans; International Cooperation; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral",2020-05-06,2020,102,5,924-925,All OA; Gold,Article,"Maffioli, Elisa M","Maffioli, Elisa M (Department of Health Management and Policy, School of Public Health, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan.)",,"Maffioli, Elisa M (University of Michigan)",University of Michigan,grid.214458.e,United States,,8,8,,,16,http://www.ajtmh.org/deliver/fulltext/14761645/102/5/tpmd200135.pdf?itemId=%2Fcontent%2Fjournals%2F10.4269%2Fajtmh.20-0135&mimeType=pdf&containerItemId=content/journals/14761645,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1125637647,11 Medical and Health Sciences,

This study aimed to investigate the effect of ACE2-overexpression on the function of MSCs and the therapeutic efficacy of MSCs for MI.   Methods MSCs were transfected with Ace2 gene using lentivirus, and then transplanted into the border zone of ischemic heart. The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) expression, nitric oxide synthase (NOS) expression, paracrine factors, anti-hypoxia ability, tube formation of MSCs, and heart function were determined.   Results MSCs expressed little ACE2. ACE2-overexpression decreased the expression of AT1 and VEGF apparently, up-regulated the paracrine of HGF, and increased the synthesis of Angiotensin 1-7 in vitro. ACE2-overexpressed MSCs showed a cytoprotective effect on cardiomyocyte, and an interesting tube formation ability, decreased the heart fibrosis and infarct size, and improved the heart function.   Conclusion Therapies employing MSCs with ACE2 overexpression may represent an effective treatment for improving the myocardium microenvironment and the cardiac function after MI.","We thank Professor Dongya Zhu, leader of Jiangsu Genetic Engineering Drug Technology Center, for generously providing the gfp transgenic rats.",bioRxiv,,,2020-05-05,2020,,,2020.05.03.075283,"All OA; Green, Published",Preprint,"Liu, Chao; Fan, Yue; Zhu, Hong-Yi; zhou, Lu; Wang, Yu; Li, Qing-Ping","Liu, Chao (Department of Pharmacology, Collaborative Innovation Center for Cardiovascular Disease Translational Medicine, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing 211166, China; Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, USA); Fan, Yue (Department of Pharmacology, Collaborative Innovation Center for Cardiovascular Disease Translational Medicine, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing 211166, China); Zhu, Hong-Yi (Department of Pharmacology, Collaborative Innovation Center for Cardiovascular Disease Translational Medicine, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing 211166, China); zhou, Lu (Department of Pharmacology, Collaborative Innovation Center for Cardiovascular Disease Translational Medicine, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing 211166, China); Wang, Yu (Department of Pharmacology, Collaborative Innovation Center for Cardiovascular Disease Translational Medicine, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing 211166, China); Li, Qing-Ping (Department of Pharmacology, Collaborative Innovation Center for Cardiovascular Disease Translational Medicine, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing 211166, China)","Liu, Chao (Nanjing Medical University; University of Michigan)","Liu, Chao (Nanjing Medical University; University of Michigan); Fan, Yue (Nanjing Medical University); Zhu, Hong-Yi (Nanjing Medical University); zhou, Lu (Nanjing Medical University); Wang, Yu (Nanjing Medical University); Li, Qing-Ping (Nanjing Medical University)",University of Michigan; Nanjing Medical University,grid.214458.e; grid.89957.3a,United States; China,Colgate-Palmolive (United States),0,0,,,1,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2020/05/05/2020.05.03.075283.full.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1127397944,1102 Cardiorespiratory Medicine and Haematology; 11 Medical and Health Sciences,

This paper outlines a proposed shared vision for leadership development drawn from a coalition of diverse medical schools. We advocate that leadership development is about self (looking inward), teams (not hierarchy), and change (looking outward). We propose that leadership development is for all medical students, not for a subset, and we believe that leadership curricula and programs must be experiential and applied. Evidence: This paper also draws on the current literature and the experience of medical schools participating in the American Medical Association's (AMA) Accelerating Change in Medical Education Consortium, confronts the common arguments against leadership training in medical education, and provides three cross-cutting principles that we believe must each be incorporated in all medical student-centered leadership development programs as they emerge and evolve at medical schools. Implications: By confronting common arguments against leadership training and providing a framework for such training, we give medical educators important tools and insights into developing leadership training for all students at their institutions.",,Teaching and Learning in Medicine,,,2020-05-02,2020,,,1-8,All OA; Gold,Article,"Mangrulkar, Rajesh S; Tsai, Antonius; Cox, Susan M; Halaas, Gwen W; Nelson, Elizabeth A; Nesse, Robert E; Silvestri, Ronald C; Radabaugh, Carrie L; Skochelak, Susan; Beck Dallaghan, Gary L; Steiner, Beat","Mangrulkar, Rajesh S (Departments of Internal Medicine and Learning Health Sciences, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.); Tsai, Antonius (Leadership Development and Education Strategy, University of Utah School of Medicine, Salt Lake City, Utah, USA.); Cox, Susan M (Department of Medical Education, Dell Medical School, University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas, USA.); Halaas, Gwen W (Academic Affairs, Washington State University, Spokane, WA, USA.); Nelson, Elizabeth A (Department of Medical Education, Dell Medical School, University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas, USA.); Nesse, Robert E (Department of Family Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.); Silvestri, Ronald C (Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.); Radabaugh, Carrie L (Medical Education Programs, American Medical Association, Chicago, Illinois, USA.); Skochelak, Susan (Medical Education, American Medical Association, Chicago, Illinois, USA.); Beck Dallaghan, Gary L (Educational Scholarship, University of North Carolina School of Medicine, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA.); Steiner, Beat (Family Medicine, University of North Carolina School of Medicine, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA.)",,"Mangrulkar, Rajesh S (University of Michigan); Tsai, Antonius (University of Utah); Cox, Susan M (The University of Texas at Austin); Halaas, Gwen W (Washington State University); Nelson, Elizabeth A (The University of Texas at Austin); Nesse, Robert E (Mayo Clinic); Silvestri, Ronald C (Harvard University); Radabaugh, Carrie L (American Medical Association); Skochelak, Susan (American Medical Association); Beck Dallaghan, Gary L (University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill); Steiner, Beat (University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill)",The University of Texas at Austin; Mayo Clinic; University of Michigan; Harvard University; University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill; Washington State University; University of Utah; American Medical Association,grid.89336.37; grid.66875.3a; grid.214458.e; grid.38142.3c; grid.10698.36; grid.30064.31; grid.223827.e; grid.413701.0,United States; United States; United States; United States; United States; United States; United States; United States,,2,2,,,9,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/10401334.2020.1754835?needAccess=true,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1127332853,1303 Specialist Studies In Education; 1302 Curriculum and Pedagogy; 13 Education,

Unfortunately, hand hygiene adherence of healthcare workers (HCWs) in Japan is suboptimal according to previous studies. OBJECTIVES: Our objectives were to evaluate hand hygiene adherence among physicians and nurses before touching hospitalized patients and to evaluate changes in hand hygiene adherence after a multimodal intervention was implemented. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We conducted a pre- and postintervention study with HCWs at four tertiary hospitals in Niigata, Japan. Hand hygiene observations were conducted from June to August 2018 (preintervention) and February to March 2019 (postintervention). INTERVENTION: The multimodal hand hygiene intervention recommended by the World Health Organization was tailored to each hospital and implemented from September 2018 to February 2019. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: We observed hand hygiene adherence before touching patients in each hospital and compared rates before and after intervention. Intervention components were also evaluated. RESULTS: There were 2,018 patient observations preintervention and 1,630 postintervention. Overall, hand hygiene adherence improved from 453 of 2,018 preintervention observations (22.4%) to 548 of 1,630 postintervention observations (33.6%; P < .001). Rates improved more among nurses (13.9 percentage points) than among doctors (5.7 percentage points). Improvement varied among the hospitals: Hospital B (18.4 percentage points) was highest, followed by Hospitals D (11.4 percentage points), C (11.3 percentage points), and Hospital A (6.5 percentage points). CONCLUSIONS: A multimodal intervention improved hand hygiene adherence rates in physicians and nurses in Niigata, Japan; however, further improvement is necessary. Given the current suboptimal hand hygiene adherence rates in Japanese hospitals, the spread of COVID-19 within the hospital setting is a concern.",,Journal of Hospital Medicine,,"Coronavirus Infections; Cross Infection; Guideline Adherence; Hand Disinfection; Hospital Units; Humans; Infectious Disease Transmission, Professional-to-Patient; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Practice Guidelines as Topic",2020-05-01,2020,15,5,262-267,All OA; Gold,Article,"Saitoh, Akihiko; Sato, Kiyomi; Magara, Yoko; Osaki, Kakuei; Narita, Kiyoko; Shioiri, Kumiko; Fowler, Karen E; Ratz, David; Saint, Sanjay","Saitoh, Akihiko (Department of Pediatrics, Niigata University Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Niigata Japan.); Sato, Kiyomi (Department of Nursing, Niigata Saiseikai Daini Hospital, Niigata, Japan.); Magara, Yoko (Department of Nursing, Niigata Saiseikai Daini Hospital, Niigata, Japan.); Osaki, Kakuei (Department of Nursing, Niigata City General Hospital, Niigata, Japan.); Narita, Kiyoko (Department of Nursing, Naga-oka Red Cross Medical Center, Niigata, Japan.); Shioiri, Kumiko (Department of Nursing, Niigata Prefectural Shibata Hospital, Niigata, Japan.); Fowler, Karen E (Center for Clinical Management Research, VA Ann Arbor Healthcare System, Ann Arbor, Michigan.); Ratz, David (Center for Clinical Management Research, VA Ann Arbor Healthcare System, Ann Arbor, Michigan.); Saint, Sanjay (Center for Clinical Management Research, VA Ann Arbor Healthcare System, Ann Arbor, Michigan.; Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, Michigan.)",,"Saitoh, Akihiko (Niigata University); Sato, Kiyomi (); Magara, Yoko (); Osaki, Kakuei (Niigata City General Hospital); Narita, Kiyoko (); Shioiri, Kumiko (Niigata Prefectural Shibata Hospital); Fowler, Karen E (VA Ann Arbor Healthcare System); Ratz, David (VA Ann Arbor Healthcare System); Saint, Sanjay (VA Ann Arbor Healthcare System; University of Michigan)",Niigata City General Hospital; VA Ann Arbor Healthcare System; Niigata University; Niigata Prefectural Shibata Hospital; University of Michigan,grid.416205.4; grid.413800.e; grid.260975.f; grid.416211.1; grid.214458.e,Japan; United States; Japan; Japan; United States,,1,1,,,2,https://cdn.mdedge.com/files/s3fs-public/issues/articles/jhm01505262.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1127428262,1117 Public Health and Health Services; 11 Medical and Health Sciences,

An international group of experts in lung cancer radiotherapy established this practice recommendation pertaining to whether and how to adapt radiotherapy for lung cancer in the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: For this ESTRO & ASTRO endorsed project, 32 experts in lung cancer radiotherapy contributed to a modified Delphi consensus process. We assessed potential adaptations of radiotherapy in two pandemic scenarios. The first, an early pandemic scenario of risk mitigation, is characterized by an altered risk-benefit ratio of radiotherapy for lung cancer patients due to their increased susceptibility for severe COVID-19 infection, and minimization of patient travelling and exposure of radiotherapy staff. The second, a later pandemic scenario, is characterized by reduced radiotherapy resources requiring patient triage. Six common lung cancer cases were assessed for both scenarios: peripherally located stage I NSCLC, locally advanced NSCLC, postoperative radiotherapy after resection of pN2 NSCLC, thoracic radiotherapy and prophylactic cranial irradiation for limited stage SCLC and palliative thoracic radiotherapy for stage IV NSCLC. RESULTS: In a risk-mitigation pandemic scenario, efforts should be made not to compromise the prognosis of lung cancer patients by departing from guideline-recommended radiotherapy practice. In that same scenario, postponement or interruption of radiotherapy treatment of COVID-19 positive patients is generally recommended to avoid exposure of cancer patients and staff to an increased risk of COVID-19 infection. In a severe pandemic scenario characterized by reduced resources, if patients must be triaged, important factors for triage include potential for cure, relative benefit of radiation, life expectancy, and performance status. Case-specific consensus recommendations regarding multimodality treatment strategies and fractionation of radiotherapy are provided. CONCLUSION: This joint ESTRO-ASTRO practice recommendation established pragmatic and balanced consensus recommendations in common clinical scenarios of radiotherapy for lung cancer in order to address the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic.",,Radiotherapy and Oncology,,"Betacoronavirus; Consensus; Coronavirus Infections; Delphi Technique; Europe; Humans; Lung Neoplasms; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Radiation Oncology; Societies, Medical; United States",2020-05,2020,146,,223-229,All OA; Gold,Article,"Guckenberger, Matthias; Belka, Claus; Bezjak, Andrea; Bradley, Jeffrey; Daly, Megan E.; DeRuysscher, Dirk; Dziadziuszko, Rafal; Faivre-Finn, Corinne; Flentje, Michael; Gore, Elizabeth; Higgins, Kristin A.; Iyengar, Puneeth; Kavanagh, Brian D; Kumar, Sameera; Le Pechoux, Cecile; Lievens, Yolande; Lindberg, Karin; McDonald, Fiona; Ramella, Sara; Rengan, Ramesh; Ricardi, Umberto; Rimner, Andreas; Rodrigues, George B.; Schild, Steven E.; Senan, Suresh; Simone, Charles B.; Slotman, Ben J.; Stuschke, Martin; Videtic, Greg; Widder, Joachim; Yom, Sue S.; Palma, David","Guckenberger, Matthias (Department of Radiation Oncology, University Hospital Zurich, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland); Belka, Claus (Department of Radiation Oncology, LMU Klinikum, LMU Munich, Munich Germany, Member of DZL Munich and DKTK Munich, Germany); Bezjak, Andrea (Department of Radiation Oncology, Princess Margaret Cancer Center, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada); Bradley, Jeffrey (Department of Radiation Oncology, Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University, Atlanta, GA, USA); Daly, Megan E.

Due to unprecedented shortages in N95 respirators, many healthcare systems have explored reprocessing of N95 respirators. Data supporting these approaches are lacking in real hospital settings. In particular, published studies have not yet reported an evaluation of multiple viruses, bacteria, and fungi along with respirator filtration and fit in a single, full-scale study. Objective: We initiated a full-scale study to evaluate different N95 FFR decontamination strategies and their impact on respirator integrity and inactivating multiple microorganisms, with experimental conditions informed by the needs and constraints of the hospital. Methods: We explored several reprocessing methods using new 3M TM 1860 N95 respirators, including dry (<10% relative humidity) and moist (62-66% relative humidity) heat (80-82 oC) in the drying cycle of industrial instrument washers, ethylene oxide (EtO), pulsed xenon UV (UV-PX), hydrogen peroxide gas plasma (HPGP), and vaporous hydrogen peroxide (VHP). Respirator samples were treated and analyzed for biological indicator inactivation using four viruses (MS2, phi6, influenza A virus, murine hepatitis virus), three bacteria ( Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Geobacillus stearothermophilus ), and the fungus Aspergillus niger . The impact of different application media was also evaluated. In parallel, decontaminated respirators were evaluated for filtration integrity and fit. Results: VHP resulted in >2 log10 inactivation of all tested biological indicators. The combination of UV-PX + moist heat resulted in >2 log10 inactivation of all biological indicators except G. stearothermohphilus . Greater than 95% filtration efficiency was maintained following 2 (UV-PX + <10% relative humidity heat) or 10 (VHP) cycles of treatment, and proper fit was also preserved. UV-PX + dry heat was insufficient to inactivate all biological indicators. Although very effective at virus decontamination, HPGP resulted in decreased filtration efficiency after 3 cycles, and EtO treatment raised potential toxicity concerns. The observed inactivation of viruses with UV-PX, heat, and hydrogen peroxide treatments varied as a function of which culture media (PBS buffer or DMEM) they were deposited in. Conclusions and Relevance: High levels of biological indicator inactivation were achieved following treatment with either moist heat or VHP. These same treatments did not significantly impact mask filtration or fit. Hospitals have a variety of scalable options to safely reprocess N95 masks. Beyond value in the current Covid-19 pandemic, the broad group of microorganisms and conditions tested make these results relevant in potential future pandemic scenarios.",,medRxiv,,,2020-04-30,2020,,,2020.04.28.20084038,"All OA; Green, Published",Preprint,"Wigginton, Krista R.; Arts, Peter J.; Clack, Herek; Fitzsimmons, William J; Gamba, Mirko; Harrison, Katherine R.; LeBar, William; Lauring, Adam S.; Li, Lucinda; Roberts, William W.; Rockey, Nicole; Torreblanca, Jania; Young, Carol; Anderegg, Loïc C.; Cohn, Amy; Doyle, John M.; Meisenhelder, Cole O.; Raskin, Lutgarde; Love, Nancy G; Kaye, Keith S.","Wigginton, Krista R.

The Training Committee of the North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition sought to understand how COVID-19 has affected pediatric gastroenterology fellowship training. METHODS: A 21 question survey was distributed to all 77 pediatric gastroenterology fellowship program directors (PDs) in the North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition program director database via email on April 7. Responses collected through April 19, 2020 were analyzed using descriptive statistics. RESULTS: Fifty-one of 77 (66%) PDs from the United States, Canada, and Mexico responded to the survey. Forty-six of 51 (90%) PDs reported that they were under a ""stay-at-home"" order for a median of 4 weeks at the time of the survey. Two of the 51 (4%) programs had fellows participating in outpatient telehealth before COVID-19 and 39 of 51 (76%) at the time of the survey. Fellows stopped participating in outpatient clinics in 22 of 51 (43%) programs and endoscopy in 26 of 51 (52%) programs. Changes to inpatient care included reduced fellow staffing, limiting who entered patient rooms, and rounding remotely. Fellows in 3 New York programs were deployed to adult medicine units. Didactics were moved to virtual conferences in 47 of 51 (94%) programs, and fellows used various online resources. Clinical research and, disproportionately, bench research were restricted. CONCLUSIONS: This report provides early information of the impact of COVID-19 on pediatric fellowship training.

Several Standard Tessellation Language (STL) files of 3D-printed masks have become available in the internet and some models have got approval from regulatory organisations such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This technical report aimed at describing a straightforward methodology for custom-fitting 3D-printed filtering masks to 3D face scans using free software. This article presents modifications of an open-source add-on program (My Face Mask, Wasp, Massa Lombarda, Italy) developed for a free computer aided-design (CAD) software (Blender 2.82, Amsterdam, Netherlands) to design a 3D-printed face mask with polylactic acid (PLA) filament, for P3 filters (99.95% filtration of airborne particles) from face scan STL files. Preliminary results demonstrated that a dental clinician was able to digitally design and 3D-print a mask that provided satisfactory comfort and adaptation.

The design (referred to as Pneumask) consists of a custom snorkel-specific adapter that couples the snorkel-port of the mask to a rated filter (either a medical-grade ventilator inline filter or an industrial filter). This design has been tested for the sealing capability of the mask, filter performance, CO2 buildup and clinical usability. These tests found the Pneumask capable of forming a seal that exceeds the standards required for half-face respirators or N95 respirators. Filter testing indicates a range of options with varying performance depending on the quality of filter selected, but with typical filter performance exceeding or comparable to the N95 standard. CO2 buildup was found to be roughly equivalent to levels found in half-face elastomeric respirators in literature. Clinical usability tests indicate sufficient visibility and, while speaking is somewhat muffled, this can be addressed via amplification (Bluetooth voice relay to cell phone speakers through an app) in noisy environments. We present guidance on the assembly, usage (donning and doffing) and decontamination protocols. The benefit of the Pneumask as PPE is that it is reusable for longer periods than typical disposable N95 respirators, as the snorkel mask can withstand rigorous decontamination protocols (that are standard to regular elastomeric respirators). With the dire worldwide shortage of PPE for medical personnel, our conclusions on the performance and efficacy of Pneumask as an N95-alternative technology are cautiously optimistic.",,medRxiv,,,2020-04-29,2020,,,2020.04.24.20078907,"All OA; Green, Published",Preprint,"Kroo, Laurel; Kothari, Anesta; Hannebelle, Melanie; Herring, George; Pollina, Thibaut; Chang, Ray; Banavar, Samhita P.; Flaum, Elliot; Soto-Montoya, Hazel; Li, Hongquan; Combes, Kyle; Pan, Emma; Vu, Khang; Yen, Kelly; Dale, James; Kolbay, Patrick; Ellgas, Simon; Konte, Rebecca; Hajian, Rozhin; Zhong, Grace; Jacobs, Noah; Jain, Amit; Kober, Filip; Ayala, Gerry; Allinne, Quentin; Cucinelli, Nicholas; Kasper, Dave; Borroni, Luca; Gerber, Patrick; Venook, Ross; Baek, Peter; Arora, Nitin; Wagner, Philip; Miki, Roberto; Kohn, Jocelyne; Bitran, David Kohn; Pearson, John; Herrera, Cristian Muniz; Prakash, Manu","Kroo, Laurel (Stanford University;); Kothari, Anesta (Stanford University;); Hannebelle, Melanie (EPFL;); Herring, George (Stanford University;); Pollina, Thibaut (Stanford University;); Chang, Ray (Stanford University;); Banavar, Samhita P.

We characterized clinical progression of COVID-19 and determined important predictors for faster clinical progression to key clinical events and longer use of medical resources. Methods and Findings: The study is a single-center, observational study with prospectively collected data from all 420 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and hospitalized in Shenzhen between January 11th and March 10th, 2020 regardless of clinical severity. Using competing risk regressions according to the methods of Fine and Gray, we found that males had faster clinical progression than females in the older age group and the difference could not be explained by difference in baseline conditions or smoking history. We estimated the proportion of cases in each severity stage over 80 days following symptom onset using a nonparametric method built upon estimated cumulative incidence of key clinical events. Based on random survival forest models, we stratified cases into risk sets with very different clinical trajectories. Those who progressed to the severe stage (22%,93/420), developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (9%,39/420), and were admitted to the intensive care unit (5%,19/420) progressed on average 9.5 days (95%CI 8.7,10.3), 11.0 days (95%CI 9.7,12.3), and 10.5 days (95%CI 8.2,13.3), respectively, after symptom onset. We estimated that patients who were admitted to ICUs remained there for an average of 34.4 days (95%CI 24.1,43.2). The median length of hospital stay was 21.3 days (95%CI, 20.5,22.2) for cases who did not progress to the severe stage, but increased to 52.1 days (95%CI, 43.3,59.5) for those who required critical care. Conclusions: Our analyses provide insights into clinical progression of cases starting early in the course of infection. Patient characteristics near symptom onset both with and without lab parameters have tremendous potential for predicting clinical progression and informing strategic response.",,medRxiv,,,2020-04-27,2020,,,2020.04.22.20076190,"All OA; Green, Published",Preprint,"Bi, Qifang; Hong, Chengcheng; Meng, Juan; Wu, Zhenke; Zhou, Pengzheng; Ye, Chenfei; Sun, Binbin; Kucirka, Lauren M; Azman, Andrew S; Wang, Tong; Chen, Jiancong; Wang, Zhaoqin; Liu, Lei; Lessler, Justin; Edwards, Jessie K; Ma, Ting; Zhang, Guoliang","Bi, Qifang (Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, MD, USA;); Hong, Chengcheng (Harbin Institute of Technology at Shenzhen, Shenzhen, Guangdong, China; Peng Cheng Laboratory, Shenzhen, Guangdong, China;); Meng, Juan (National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, Shenzhen Third People's Hospital, Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen, Guangdong, China;); Wu, Zhenke (University of Michigan School of Public Health, Ann Arbor, MI, USA; Michigan Institute for Data Science, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA;); Zhou, Pengzheng (Peng Cheng Laboratory, Shenzhen, Guangdong, China;); Ye, Chenfei (Peng Cheng Laboratory, Shenzhen, Guangdong, China;); Sun, Binbin (Harbin Institute of Technology at Shenzhen, Shenzhen, Guangdong, China; Peng Cheng Laboratory, Shenzhen, Guangdong, China;); Kucirka, Lauren M (Johns Hopkins School of Medicine;); Azman, Andrew S (Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health;); Wang, Tong (Harbin Institute of Technology at Shenzhen, Shenzhen, Guangdong, China;); Chen, Jiancong (Peng Cheng Laboratory, Shenzhen, Guangdong, China;); Wang, Zhaoqin (National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, Shenzhen Third People's Hospital, Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen, Guangdong, China;); Liu, Lei (National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, Shenzhen Third People's Hospital, Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen, Guangdong, China;); Lessler, Justin (Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health;); Edwards, Jessie K (University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill); Ma, Ting (Harbin Institute of Technology at Shenzhen, Shenzhen, Guangdong, China; Peng Cheng Laboratory, Shenzhen, Guangdong, China;); Zhang, Guoliang (National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, Shenzhen Third People's Hospital, Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen, Guangdong, China;)",,"Bi, Qifang (Johns Hopkins University); Hong, Chengcheng (Harbin Institute of Technology); Meng, Juan (Southern University of Science and Technology); Wu, Zhenke (University of Michigan); Zhou, Pengzheng (); Ye, Chenfei (); Sun, Binbin (Harbin Institute of Technology); Kucirka, Lauren M (Johns Hopkins University); Azman, Andrew S (Johns Hopkins University); Wang, Tong (Harbin Institute of Technology); Chen, Jiancong (); Wang, Zhaoqin (Southern University of Science and Technology); Liu, Lei (Southern University of Science and Technology); Lessler, Justin (Johns Hopkins University); Edwards, Jessie K (University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill); Ma, Ting (Harbin Institute of Technology); Zhang, Guoliang (Southern University of Science and Technology)",Johns Hopkins University; University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill; Southern University of Science and Technology; Harbin Institute of Technology; University of Michigan,grid.21107.35; grid.10698.36; grid.263817.9; grid.19373.3f; grid.214458.e,United States; United States; China; China; United States,,5,5,,,19,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2020/05/13/2020.04.22.20076190.full.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1127151875,1117 Public Health and Health Services; 11 Medical and Health Sciences,

However, early data from the COVID-19 pandemic has underscored that the burden of respiratory viruses actually reflect and magnify existing socioeconomic inequalities. We review the literature on socioeconomic and racial disparities in acute respiratory infection (ARI), as well as ARI-associated hospitalization and mortality. Our goal is to identify key principles of the relationship between socioeconomic inequality and ARI outcomes, as well as highlighting poorly understood areas that need to be addressed by research and policy in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. We find that there has been descriptive work in this area, but that there is a distinct lack of cohesive methodology in the literature exploring social determinants and ARI. We propose the fundamental cause theory is a useful framework for guiding future research of disparities in ARI and for the design of interventions to alleviate these disparities.",,medRxiv,,,2020-04-26,2020,,,2020.04.22.20069781,"All OA; Green, Published",Preprint,"Moran, Elizabeth; Kubale, John; Noppert, Grace; Malosh, Ryan E; Zelner, Jon L","Moran, Elizabeth (University of Michigan School of Public Health;); Kubale, John (University of Michigan School of Public Health;); Noppert, Grace (Carolina Population Center, University of North Carolina - Chapel Hill); Malosh, Ryan E (University of Michigan School of Public Health;); Zelner, Jon L (University of Michigan School of Public Health;)",,"Moran, Elizabeth (University of Michigan); Kubale, John (University of Michigan); Noppert, Grace (); Malosh, Ryan E (University of Michigan); Zelner, Jon L (University of Michigan)",University of Michigan,grid.214458.e,United States,,1,1,,,2,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2020/04/26/2020.04.22.20069781.full.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1127148394,1117 Public Health and Health Services; 11 Medical and Health Sciences,10 Reduced Inequalities

Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) are extracellular webs of chromatin, microbicidal proteins, and oxidant enzymes that are released by neutrophils to contain infections. However, when not properly regulated, NETs have the potential to propagate inflammation and microvascular thrombosis - including in the lungs of patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome. We now report that sera from patients with COVID-19 have elevated levels of cell-free DNA, myeloperoxidase-DNA (MPO-DNA), and citrullinated histone H3 (Cit-H3); the latter 2 are specific markers of NETs. Highlighting the potential clinical relevance of these findings, cell-free DNA strongly correlated with acute-phase reactants, including C-reactive protein, D-dimer, and lactate dehydrogenase, as well as absolute neutrophil count. MPO-DNA associated with both cell-free DNA and absolute neutrophil count, while Cit-H3 correlated with platelet levels. Importantly, both cell-free DNA and MPO-DNA were higher in hospitalized patients receiving mechanical ventilation as compared with hospitalized patients breathing room air. Finally, sera from individuals with COVID-19 triggered NET release from control neutrophils in vitro. Future studies should investigate the predictive power of circulating NETs in longitudinal cohorts and determine the extent to which NETs may be novel therapeutic targets in severe COVID-19.",,JCI Insight,,"Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; C-Reactive Protein; Case-Control Studies; Cell-Free Nucleic Acids; Citrullination; Coronavirus Infections; Extracellular Traps; Female; Fibrin Fibrinogen Degradation Products; Histones; Humans; In Vitro Techniques; L-Lactate Dehydrogenase; Lymphocyte Count; Male; Middle Aged; Neutrophils; Pandemics; Peroxidase; Platelet Count; Pneumonia, Viral; Respiration, Artificial; Severity of Illness Index",2020-04-24,2020,5,11,,All OA; Gold,Article,"Zuo, Yu; Yalavarthi, Srilakshmi; Shi, Hui; Gockman, Kelsey; Zuo, Melanie; Madison, Jacqueline A; Blair, Christopher; Weber, Andrew; Barnes, Betsy J; Egeblad, Mikala; Woods, Robert J; Kanthi, Yogendra; Knight, Jason S","Zuo, Yu (Division of Rheumatology, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.); Yalavarthi, Srilakshmi (Division of Rheumatology, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.); Shi, Hui (Division of Rheumatology, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.; Division of Rheumatology, Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.); Gockman, Kelsey (Division of Rheumatology, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.); Zuo, Melanie (Division of Geriatric and Palliative Medicine and.); Madison, Jacqueline A (Division of Rheumatology, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.); Blair, Christopher (Division of Infectious Disease, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.); Weber, Andrew (Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care, and Sleep Medicine, Department of Medicine, Northwell Health, New York, New York, USA.); Barnes, Betsy J (Center for Autoimmune, Musculoskeletal and Hematopoietic Diseases, The Feinstein Institutes for Medical Research, Manhasset, New York, USA.; Departments of Molecular Medicine and Pediatrics, Donald and Barbara Zucker School of Medicine at Hofstra/Northwell, Hempstead, New York, USA.); Egeblad, Mikala (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York, USA.); Woods, Robert J (Division of Infectious Disease, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.); Kanthi, Yogendra (Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.; Division of Cardiology, VA Ann Arbor Healthcare System, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.); Knight, Jason S (Division of Rheumatology, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.)","Knight, Jason S (University of Michigan)","Zuo, Yu (University of Michigan); Yalavarthi, Srilakshmi (University of Michigan); Shi, Hui (University of Michigan; Shanghai Jiao Tong University); Gockman, Kelsey (University of Michigan); Zuo, Melanie (); Madison, Jacqueline A (University of Michigan); Blair, Christopher (University of Michigan); Weber, Andrew (Northwell Health); Barnes, Betsy J (Hofstra University); Egeblad, Mikala (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory); Woods, Robert J (University of Michigan); Kanthi, Yogendra (University of Michigan; VA Ann Arbor Healthcare System); Knight, Jason S (University of Michigan)",Shanghai Jiao Tong University; Northwell Health; University of Michigan; Hofstra University; VA Ann Arbor Healthcare System; Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory,grid.16821.3c; grid.416477.7; grid.214458.e; grid.257060.6; grid.413800.e; grid.225279.9,China; United States; United States; United States; United States; United States,Wellcome Trust; National Heart Lung and Blood Institute,188,188,,,229,https://doi.org/10.1172/jci.insight.138999,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1126925966,0601 Biochemistry and Cell Biology; 06 Biological Sciences,

Assessing infection attack rates in the population is critical for estimating disease severity and herd immunity which is needed to calibrate public health interventions. We have previously shown that it is possible to achieve this in real time to impact public health decision making.AimOur objective was to develop and evaluate serological assays applicable in large-scale sero-epidemiological studies.MethodsWe developed an ELISA to detect IgG and IgM antibodies to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We evaluated its sensitivity and specificity in combination with confirmatory microneutralisation (MN) and 90% plaque reduction neutralisation tests (PRNT90) in 51 sera from 24 patients with virologically confirmed COVID-19 and in age-stratified sera from 200 healthy controls.ResultsIgG and IgM RBD ELISA, MN and PRNT90 were reliably positive after 29 days from illness onset with no detectable cross-reactivity in age-stratified controls. We found that PRNT90 tests were more sensitive in detecting antibody than MN tests carried out with the conventional 100 tissue culture infectious dose challenge. Heparinised plasma appeared to reduce the infectivity of the virus challenge dose and may confound interpretation of neutralisation test.ConclusionUsing IgG ELISA based on the RBD of the spike protein to screen sera for SARS-CoV-2 antibody, followed by confirmation using PRNT90, is a valid approach for large-scale sero-epidemiology studies.","We acknowledge the support of the clinicians who facilitated this study including Drs John Yu Hong Chan, Daphne Pui-Lin Lau, and Ying Man Ho and the clinical team at Infectious Diseases Centre, Princess Margaret Hospital, Hospital Authority of Hong Kong and the patients who consented to participate in this investigation.

HAdV outbreaks are well documented in congregate military training settings, but less is known about outbreaks on college campuses. During fall 2018 and spring 2019, five U.S. colleges reported increases in HAdV-associated respiratory illness. Investigations were performed to better understand HAdV epidemiology in this setting. METHODS: A case was a student at one of the five colleges with acute respiratory illness and laboratory-confirmed HAdV infection during October 2018-December 2018 or March-May 2019. Available respiratory specimens were typed by HAdV type-specific real-time PCR assays, and for a subset, whole genome sequencing was performed. We reviewed available medical records and cases were invited to complete a questionnaire, which included questions on symptom presentation, social history, and absenteeism. RESULTS: We identified 168 HAdV cases. Median age was 19 (range: 17-22) years and 102 cases (61%) were male. Eleven cases were hospitalized, 10 with pneumonia; two cases died. Among questionnaire respondents, 80% (75/94) missed ≥1 day of class because of their illness. Among those with a type identified (79%), HAdV types 4 and 7 were equally detected, with frequency of each varying by site. Genome types 4a1 and 7d were identified, respectively, by whole genome sequence analysis. CONCLUSIONS: HAdV respiratory illness was associated with substantial morbidity and missed class time among young, generally healthy adults on five U.S. college campuses. HAdVs should be considered a cause of respiratory illness outbreaks in congregate settings such as college campuses.",,Clinical Infectious Diseases,,,2020-04-23,2020,,,,All OA; Gold,Article,"Kujawski, Stephanie A;

Clinical practice has demonstrated that the SARS-CoV-2 S1 specific antibodies and viral antigens can be used as diagnostic and prognostic markers of COVID-19. However, the popular point-of-care biomarker detection technologies, such as the lateral-flow test strips, provide only yes/no information and have very limited sensitivities. Thus, it has a high false negative rate and cannot be used for the quantitative evaluation of patient’s immune response. Conventional ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay), on the other hand, can provide quantitative, accurate, and sensitive results, but it involves complicated and expensive instruments and long assay time. In addition, samples need to be sent to centralized labs, which significantly increases the turn-around time. Here, we present a microfluidic ELISA technology for rapid (15-20 minutes), quantitative, sensitive detection of SARS-CoV-2 biomarkers using SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG and viral antigen – S protein in serum. We also characterized various humanized monoclonal IgG, and identified a candidate with a high binding affinity towards SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein that can serve as the calibration standard of anti-SARS-CoV-2 S1 IgG in serological analyses. Furthermore, we demonstrated that our microfluidic ELISA platform can be used for rapid affinity evaluation of monoclonal anti-S1 antibodies. The microfluidic ELISA device is highly portable and requires less than 10 μL of samples for each channel. Therefore, our technology will greatly facilitate rapid and quantitative analysis of COVID-19 patients and vaccine recipients at point-of-care.",The authors thank the financial support from the Department of Biomedical Engineering.,bioRxiv,,,2020-04-22,2020,,,2020.04.20.052233,"All OA; Green, Published",Preprint,"Tan, Xiaotian; Lin, Cory; Zhang, Jie; Oo, Maung Kyaw Khaing; Fan, Xudong","Tan, Xiaotian (Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, USA); Lin, Cory (Sino Biological Inc, Beijing, 100176, China); Zhang, Jie (Sino Biological Inc, Beijing, 100176, China; Beijing key laboratory of monoclonal antibody research and development Beijing, 100176, China); Oo, Maung Kyaw Khaing (Optofluidic Bioassay, LLC, Ann Arbor, MI 48103, USA); Fan, Xudong (Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, USA)","Oo, Maung Kyaw Khaing ","Tan, Xiaotian (University of Michigan); Lin, Cory (); Zhang, Jie (); Oo, Maung Kyaw Khaing (); Fan, Xudong (University of Michigan)",University of Michigan,grid.214458.e,United States,,4,4,,,4,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2020/04/22/2020.04.20.052233.full.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1126888026,10 Technology; 11 Medical and Health Sciences; 1004 Medical Biotechnology; 03 Chemical Sciences; 0301 Analytical Chemistry; 1107 Immunology,

With only 536 COVID-19 cases and 11 fatalities, India - a democracy of 1.34 billion people - took the historic decision of a 21-day national lockdown on March 25. The lockdown was further extended to May 3, soon after the analysis of this paper was completed. Objective: To study the short- and long-term impact of an initial 21-day lockdown on the total number of COVID-19 cases in India compared to other less severe non-pharmaceutical interventions using epidemiological forecasting models and Bayesian estimation algorithms; to compare effects of hypothetical durations of lockdown from an epidemiological perspective; to study alternative explanations for slower growth rate of the virus outbreak in India, including exploring the association of the number of cases and average monthly temperature; and finally, to outline the pivotal role of reliable and transparent data, reproducible data science methods, tools and products as we reopen the country and prepare for a post lock-down phase of the pandemic. Design, Setting, and Participants: We use the daily data on the number of COVID-19 cases, of recovered and of deaths from March 1 until April 7, 2020 from the 2019 Novel Coronavirus Visual Dashboard operated by the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CSSE). Additionally, we use COVID-19 incidence counts data from Kaggle and the monthly average temperature of major cities across the world from Wikipedia. Main Outcome and Measures: The current time-series data on daily proportions of cases and removed (recovered and death combined) from India are analyzed using an extended version of the standard SIR (susceptible, infected, and removed) model. The eSIR model incorporates time-varying transmission rates that help us predict the effect of lockdown compared to other hypothetical interventions on the number of cases at future time points. A Markov Chain Monte Carlo implementation of this model provided predicted proportions of the cases at future time points along with credible intervals (CI). Results: Our predicted cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in India on April 30 assuming a 1-week delay in people's adherence to a 21-day lockdown (March 25 - April 14) and a gradual, moderate resumption of daily activities after April 14 is 9,181 with upper 95% CI of 72,245. In comparison, the predicted cumulative number of cases under ""no intervention"" and ""social distancing and travel bans without lockdown"" are 358 thousand and 46 thousand (upper 95% CI of nearly 2.3 million and 0.3 million) respectively. An effective lockdown can prevent roughly 343 thousand (upper 95% CI 1.8 million) and 2.4 million (upper 95% CI 38.4 million) COVID-19 cases nationwide compared to social distancing alone by May 15 and June 15, respectively. When comparing a 21-day lockdown with a hypothetical lockdown of longer duration, we find that 28-, 42-, and 56-day lockdowns can approximately prevent 238 thousand (upper 95% CI 2.3 million), 622 thousand (upper 95% CI 4.3 million), 781 thousand (upper 95% CI 4.6 million) cases by June 15, respectively. We find some suggestive evidence that the COVID-19 incidence rates worldwide are negatively associated with temperature in a crude unadjusted analysis with Pearson correlation estimates [95% confidence interval] between average monthly temperature and total monthly incidence around the world being -0.185 [-0.548, 0.236] for January, -0.110 [-0.362, 0.157] for February, and -0.173 [-0.314, -0.026] for March. Conclusions and Relevance: The lockdown, if implemented correctly in the end, has a high chance of reducing the total number of COVID-19 cases in the short term, and buy India invaluable time to prepare its healthcare and disease monitoring system. Our analysis shows we need to have some measures of suppression in place after the lockdown for the best outcome. We cannot heavily rely on the hypothetical prevention governed by meteorological factors such as temperature based on current evidence. From an epidemiological perspective, a longer lockdown between 42-56 days is preferable. However, the lockdown comes at a tremendous price to social and economic health through a contagion process not dissimilar to that of the coronavirus itself. Data can play a defining role as we design post-lockdown testing, reopening and resource allocation strategies. Software: Our contribution to data science includes an interactive and dynamic app (covind19.org) with short- and long-term projections updated daily that can help inform policy and practice related to COVID-19 in India. Anyone can visualize the observed data for India and create predictions under hypothetical scenarios with quantification of uncertainties.

Lung inflammation is accompanied or led by massive accumulation of neutrophils in pulmonary capillaries (“margination”). We sought to identify nanostructural properties that predispose nanoparticles to accumulate in pulmonary marginated neutrophils, and therefore to target severely inflamed lungs. We designed a library of nanoparticles and conducted an in vivo screen of biodistributions in naive mice and mice treated with lipopolysaccharides. We found that supramolecular organization of protein in nanoparticles predicts uptake in inflamed lungs. Specifically, nanoparticles with agglutinated protein (NAPs) efficiently home to pulmonary neutrophils, while protein nanoparticles with symmetric structure ( e.g. viral capsids) are ignored by pulmonary neutrophils. We validated this finding by engineering protein-conjugated liposomes that recapitulate NAP targeting to neutrophils in inflamed lungs. We show that NAPs can diagnose acute lung injury in SPECT imaging and that NAP-like liposomes can mitigate neutrophil extravasation and pulmonary edema arising in lung inflammation. Finally, we demonstrate that ischemic ex vivo human lungs selectively take up NAPs, illustrating translational potential. This work demonstrates that structure-dependent interactions with neutrophils can dramatically alter the biodistribution of nanoparticles, and NAPs have significant potential in detecting and treating respiratory conditions arising from injury or infections.","This research was supported by NIH R01HL125462 (V.R.M.).

There is no approved drug or vaccine for COVID-19, although more than 10 clinical trials have been launched to test potential drugs. In an urgent response to this pandemic, I developed a bioinformatics pipeline to identify compounds and drug candidates to potentially treat COVID-19. This pipeline is based on publicly available single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data and the drug perturbation database ""Library of Integrated Network-Based Cellular Signatures"" (LINCS). I developed a ranking score system that prioritizes these drugs or small molecules. The four drugs with the highest total score are didanosine, benzyl-quinazolin-4-yl-amine, camptothecin, and RO-90-7501.

This disparity may reflect different airway levels of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor, ACE2, and the spike protein activator, TMPRSS2. Here we explore the role of genetics and co-expression networks in regulating these genes in the airway, through the analysis of nasal airway transcriptome data from 695 children. We identify expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) for both ACE2 and TMPRSS2, that vary in frequency across world populations. Importantly, we find TMPRSS2 is part of a mucus secretory network, highly upregulated by T2 inflammation through the action of interleukin-13, and that interferon response to respiratory viruses highly upregulates ACE2 expression. Finally, we define airway responses to coronavirus infections in children, finding that these infections upregulate IL6 while also stimulating a more pronounced cytotoxic immune response relative to other respiratory viruses.

Decisions surrounding surveillance design parameters, such as the number and placement of surveillance sites, target populations, and case definitions, are often determined by expert opinion or deference to operational considerations, without formal analysis of the influence of design parameters on surveillance objectives. Here we propose a simulation framework to guide evidence-based surveillance network design to better achieve specific surveillance goals with limited resources. We define evidence-based surveillance design as a constrained, multi-dimensional, multi-objective, dynamic optimization problem, acknowledging the many operational constraints under which surveillance systems operate, the many dimensions of surveillance system design, the multiple and competing goals of surveillance, and the complex and dynamic nature of disease systems. We describe an analytical framework for the identification of optimal designs through mathematical representations of disease and surveillance processes, definition of objective functions, and the approach to numerical optimization. We then apply the framework to the problem of selecting candidate sites to expand an existing surveillance network under alternative objectives of: (1) improving spatial prediction of disease prevalence at unmonitored sites; or (2) estimating the observed effect of a risk factor on disease. Results of this demonstration illustrate how optimal designs are sensitive to both surveillance goals and the underlying spatial pattern of the target disease. The findings affirm the value of designing surveillance systems through quantitative and adaptive analysis of network characteristics and performance. The framework can be applied to the design of surveillance systems tailored to setting-specific disease transmission dynamics and surveillance needs, and can yield improved understanding of tradeoffs between network architectures.",,medRxiv,,,2020-04-10,2020,,,2020.04.06.20048231,"All OA; Green, Published",Preprint,"Cheng, Qu; Collender, Philip A.; Heaney, Alexandra K.; Li, Xintong; Dasan, Rohini; Li, Charles; Lewnard, Joseph; Zelner, Jon; Liang, Song; Chang, Howard H.; Waller, Lance A.; Lopman, Benjamin A.; Yang, Changhong; Remais, Justin V.","Cheng, Qu (Division of Environmental Health Sciences, School of Public Health, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley 94720, USA;); Collender, Philip A.

Roughly half of all opioids are prescribed in primary care. Although clinical guidelines describe recommended opioid prescribing practices, implementing these guidelines in a way that balances safety and effectiveness vs. risk remains a challenge. The literature offers little help about which implementation strategies work best in different clinical settings or how strategies could be tailored to optimize their effectiveness in different contexts. Systems consultation consists of: (1) educational/engagement meetings with audit and feedback reports, (2) practice facilitation, and (3) prescriber peer consulting. The study is designed to discover the most cost-effective sequence and combination of strategies for improving opioid prescribing practices in diverse primary care clinics.Methods/Design The study is a hybrid type 3 clustered, sequential, multiple-assignment randomized trial (SMART) that randomizes clinics from two health systems at two points, months 3 and 9, of a 21-month intervention. Clinics are provided one of four sequences of implementation strategies: a condition consisting of educational/engagement meetings and audit and feedback alone (EM/AF), EM/AF plus practice facilitation (PF), EM/AF + prescriber peer consulting (PPC), and EM/AF + PF + PPC. The study’s primary outcome is morphine-milligram equivalent (MME) dose by prescribing clinicians within clinics. The study’s primary aim is the comparison of EM/AF + PF + PPC versus EM/AF alone on change in MME from month 3 to month 21. The secondary aim is to derive cost estimates for each of the four sequences and compare them. The exploratory aim is to examine four tailoring variables that can be used to construct an adaptive implementation strategy to meet the needs of different primary care clinics.Discussion Systems consultation is a practical blend of implementation strategies used in this case to improve opioid prescribing practices in primary care. The blend offers a range of strategies in sequences from minimally to substantially intensive. The results of this study promise to help us understand how to cost effectively improve the implementation of evidence-based practices.Trial registration NCT 04044521 (ClinicalTrial.gov).

Here, we compared countries that mandated BCG vaccination at least until 2000 with to countries that did not (140 countries in total). To minimize any systematic effects of reporting biases, we analyzed the rate of the day-by-day increase in both confirmed cases and deaths in the first 30-day period of country-wise outbreaks. The 30-day window was adjusted to begin at the country-wise onset of the pandemic. Linear mixed models revealed a significant effect of mandated BCG policies on the growth rate of both cases and deaths after controlling for median age, gross domestic product per capita, population density, population size, net migration rate, and various cultural dimensions (e.g., individualism and the tightness vs. looseness of social norms).

Making the problem worse, there is no specific antiviral drug that can be used to treat COVID-19 to date. SARS-CoV-2 initiates its entry into human cells by binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) via the receptor binding domain (RBD) of its spike protein. Therefore, molecules that can block SARS-CoV-2 from binding to hACE2 may potentially prevent the virus from entering human cells and serve as an effective antiviral drug. Based on this idea, we designed a series of peptides that can strongly bind to SARS-CoV-2 RBD in computational experiments. Specifically, we first constructed a 31-mer peptidic scaffold by linking two fragments grafted from hACE2 (a.a. 22-44 and 351-357) with a linker glycine, and then redesigned the peptide sequence to enhance its binding affinity to SARS-CoV-2 RBD. Compared with several computational studies that failed to identify that SARS-CoV-2 shows higher binding affinity for hACE2 than SARS-CoV, our protein design scoring function, EvoEF2, makes a correct identification, which is consistent with the recently reported experimental data, implying its high accuracy. The top designed peptide binders exhibited much stronger binding potency to hACE2 than the wild-type (−53.35 vs. −46.46 EvoEF2 energy unit for design and wild-type, respectively). The extensive and detailed computational analyses support the high reasonability of the designed binders, which not only recapitulated the critical native binding interactions but also introduced new favorable interactions to enhance binding. Due to the urgent situation created by COVID-19, we share these computational data to the community, which should be helpful to develop potential antiviral peptide drugs to combat this pandemic.",The work used the XSEDE clusters39 which is supported by the National Science Foundation (ACI-1548562).,bioRxiv,,,2020-03-31,2020,,,2020.03.28.013607,"All OA; Green, Published",Preprint,"Huang, Xiaoqiang; Pearce, Robin; Zhang, Yang","Huang, Xiaoqiang (Department of Computational Medicine and Bioinformatics, University of Michigan, 100 Washtenaw Avenue, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, USA); Pearce, Robin (Department of Computational Medicine and Bioinformatics, University of Michigan, 100 Washtenaw Avenue, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, USA); Zhang, Yang (Department of Computational Medicine and Bioinformatics, University of Michigan, 100 Washtenaw Avenue, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, USA; Department of Biological Chemistry, University of Michigan, 100 Washtenaw Avenue, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, USA)","Zhang, Yang (University of Michigan; University of Michigan)","Huang, Xiaoqiang (University of Michigan); Pearce, Robin (University of Michigan); Zhang, Yang (University of Michigan; University of Michigan)",University of Michigan,grid.214458.e,United States,Directorate for Computer & Information Science & Engineering,11,11,,,12,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2020/03/31/2020.03.28.013607.full.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1126020192,1108 Medical Microbiology; 11 Medical and Health Sciences,

There is limited evidence on the mortality risk effect of pre-existing comorbidities for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which has important implications for early treatment. Objective: Evaluate the risk of pre-existing comorbidities on COVID-19 mortality, and provide clinical suggestions accordingly. Method: This study used a nested case-control design. A total of 94 publicly reported deaths in locations outside of Hubei Province, China, between December 18th, 2019 and March 8th, 2020 were included as cases. Each case was matched with up to three controls, based on gender and age (94 cases and 181 controls). The inverse-probability-weighted Cox proportional hazard model was performed. Results: History of comorbidities significantly increased the death risk of COVID-19: one additional pre-existing comorbidity led to an estimated 40% higher risk of death (p<0.001). The estimated mortality risk in patients with CHD was three times of those without CHD (p<0.001). The estimated 30-day survival probability for a profile patient with pre-existing CHD (65-year-old female with no other comorbidities) was 0.53 (95% CI [0.34-0.82]), while it was 0.85 (95% CI [0.79-0.91]) for those without CHD. Older age was also associated with increased death risk: every 5-year increase in age was associated with a 20% increased risk of mortality (p<0.001).

During the current COVID-19 pandemic, social distancing guidelines require alternative data collection in order protect both research staff and participants. Home-collected respiratory specimens are less resource intensive, can be collected earlier after symptom onset, and provide a low-contact means of data collection. A prospective, multi-year, community-based cohort study is an ideal setting to examine the utility of home-collected specimens for identification of influenza. Methods: We describe the feasibility and reliability of home-collected specimens for the detection of influenza. We collected data and specimens between October 2014 and June 2017 from the Household Influenza Vaccine Evaluation (HIVE) Study. Cohort participants were asked to collect a nasal swab at home upon onset of acute respiratory illness. Research staff also collected nose and throat swab specimens in the study clinic within 7 days of onset. We estimated agreement using Cohen's kappa and calculated sensitivity and specificity of home-collected compared to staff-collected specimens. Results: We tested 336 paired staff- and home-collected respiratory specimens for influenza by RT-PCR; 150 staff-collected specimens were positive for influenza A/H3N2, 23 for influenza A/H1N1, 14 for influenza B/Victoria, and 31 for influenza B/Yamagata. We found moderate agreement between collection methods for influenza A/H3N2 (0.70) and B/Yamagata (0.69) and high agreement for influenza A/H1N1 (0.87) and B/Victoria (0.86). Sensitivity ranged from 78-86% for all influenza types and subtypes. Specificity was high for influenza A/H1N1 and both influenza B lineages with a range from 96-100%, and slightly lower for A/H3N2 infections (88%).

There are currently no antiviral drugs with proven efficacy nor are there vaccines for its prevention. Unfortunately, the scientific community has little knowledge of the molecular details of SARS-CoV-2 infection. To illuminate this, we cloned, tagged and expressed 26 of the 29 viral proteins in human cells and identified the human proteins physically associated with each using affinity- purification mass spectrometry (AP-MS), which identified 332 high confidence SARS-CoV-2-human protein-protein interactions (PPIs). Among these, we identify 66 druggable human proteins or host factors targeted by 69 existing FDA-approved drugs, drugs in clinical trials and/or preclinical compounds, that we are currently evaluating for efficacy in live SARS-CoV-2 infection assays. The identification of host dependency factors mediating virus infection may provide key insights into effective molecular targets for developing broadly acting antiviral therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2 and other deadly coronavirus strains.",,bioRxiv,,,2020-03-22,2020,,,,"All OA; Green, Published",Preprint,"Gordon, David E; Jang, Gwendolyn M; Bouhaddou, Mehdi; Xu, Jiewei; Obernier, Kirsten; O'Meara, Matthew J; Guo, Jeffrey Z; Swaney, Danielle L; Tummino, Tia A; Hüttenhain, Ruth; Kaake, Robyn M; Richards, Alicia L; Tutuncuoglu, Beril; Foussard, Helene; Batra, Jyoti; Haas, Kelsey; Modak, Maya; Kim, Minkyu; Haas, Paige; Polacco, Benjamin J; Braberg, Hannes; Fabius, Jacqueline M; Eckhardt, Manon; Soucheray, Margaret; Bennett, Melanie J; Cakir, Merve; McGregor, Michael J; Li, Qiongyu; Naing, Zun Zar Chi; Zhou, Yuan; Peng, Shiming; Kirby, Ilsa T; Melnyk, James E; Chorba, John S; Lou, Kevin; Dai, Shizhong A; Shen, Wenqi; Shi, Ying; Zhang, Ziyang; Barrio-Hernandez, Inigo; Memon, Danish; Hernandez-Armenta, Claudia; Mathy, Christopher J P; Perica, Tina; Pilla, Kala B; Ganesan, Sai J; Saltzberg, Daniel J; Ramachandran, Rakesh; Liu, Xi; Rosenthal, Sara B; Calviello, Lorenzo; Venkataramanan, Srivats; Lin, Yizhu; Wankowicz, Stephanie A; Bohn, Markus; Trenker, Raphael; Young, Janet M; Cavero, Devin; Hiatt, Joe; Roth, Theo; Rathore, Ujjwal; Subramanian, Advait; Noack, Julia; Hubert, Mathieu; Roesch, Ferdinand; Vallet, Thomas; Meyer, Björn; White, Kris M; Miorin, Lisa; Agard, David; Emerman, Michael; Ruggero, Davide; García-Sastre, Adolfo; Jura, Natalia; von Zastrow, Mark; Taunton, Jack; Schwartz, Olivier; Vignuzzi, Marco; d'Enfert, Christophe; Mukherjee, Shaeri; Jacobson, Matt; Malik, Harmit S; Fujimori, Danica G; Ideker, Trey; Craik, Charles S; Floor, Stephen; Fraser, James S; Gross, John; Sali, Andrej; Kortemme, Tanja; Beltrao, Pedro; Shokat, Kevan; Shoichet, Brian K; Krogan, Nevan J","Gordon, David E (QBI COVID-19 Research Group (QCRG), San Francisco, CA, 94158, USA.; University of California San Francisco, Quantitative Biosciences Institute (QBI), San Francisco, CA, 94158, USA.; J.

Our literature and clinical trial survey showed that the whole virus, as well as the spike (S) protein, nucleocapsid (N) protein, and membrane protein, have been tested for vaccine development against SARS and MERS. We further used the Vaxign reverse vaccinology tool and the newly developed Vaxign-ML machine learning tool to predict COVID-19 vaccine candidates. The N protein was found to be conserved in the more pathogenic strains (SARS/MERS/COVID-19), but not in the other human coronaviruses that mostly cause mild symptoms. By investigating the entire proteome of SARS-CoV-2, six proteins, including the S protein and five non-structural proteins (nsp3, 3CL-pro, and nsp8-10) were predicted to be adhesins, which are crucial to the viral adhering and host invasion. The S, nsp3, and nsp8 proteins were also predicted by Vaxign-ML to induce high protective antigenicity. Besides the commonly used S protein, the nsp3 protein has not been tested in any coronavirus vaccine studies and was selected for further investigation. The nsp3 was found to be more conserved among SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV than among 15 coronaviruses infecting human and other animals. The protein was also predicted to contain promiscuous MHC-I and MHC-II T-cell epitopes, and linear B-cell epitopes localized in specific locations and functional domains of the protein. Our predicted vaccine targets provide new strategies for effective and safe COVID-19 vaccine development.",,,,,2020-03-21,2020,,,,"All OA; Green, Published",Article,"Ong, Edison; Wong, Mei U; Huffman, Anthony; He, Yongqun","Ong, Edison (Department of Computational Medicine and Bioinformatics, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, USA.); Wong, Mei U (Unit for Laboratory Animal Medicine, Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, USA.); Huffman, Anthony (Department of Computational Medicine and Bioinformatics, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, USA.); He, Yongqun (Department of Computational Medicine and Bioinformatics, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, USA.; Unit for Laboratory Animal Medicine, Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, USA.)",,"Ong, Edison (University of Michigan); Wong, Mei U (University of Michigan); Huffman, Anthony (University of Michigan); He, Yongqun (University of Michigan; University of Michigan)",University of Michigan,grid.214458.e,United States,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,23,23,,,44,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2020/03/23/2020.03.20.000141.full.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1125816318,1108 Medical Microbiology; 11 Medical and Health Sciences; 0601 Biochemistry and Cell Biology; 06 Biological Sciences,3 Good Health and Well Being

Cases were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR and were analyzed for epidemiological, demographic, clinical, and radiological features. Outcomes were followed up until Feb 18, 2020. Results 38 initial scans and 62 follow-up scans were obtained. 28 (74%) patients had the history of travel to or residence in Hubei Province of China in 14 days prior to the illness onset. Common findings included ground-glass opacification (GGO), sometimes mixed with consolidation, and interlobular septal and intralobular interstitial thickening. Follow-up imaging often demonstrated peripheral GGO and consolidations spreading to the remainder of the lungs and the increasing consolidative component reflecting the progression of the disease. 8 patients (21%) whose swabs or serum were positive for COVID-19 had no imaging findings on CT throughout the disease course. After treatment the serum and sputum tests became negative for COVID-19 in 32(84%) cases. 28(74%) patients were discharged and three (8%) of them were transferred to the Observation Ward, while seven (18%) patients were kept in Isolation Ward. Conclusion The commonest pattern observed was GGO alone or GGO mixed with consolidation predominantly in lower and peripheral lungs.

We present estimates of the basic reproduction number, R0, of 2019-nCoV in the early phase of the outbreak. METHODS: Accounting for the impact of the variations in disease reporting rate, we modelled the epidemic curve of 2019-nCoV cases time series, in mainland China from January 10 to January 24, 2020, through the exponential growth. With the estimated intrinsic growth rate (γ), we estimated R0 by using the serial intervals (SI) of two other well-known coronavirus diseases, MERS and SARS, as approximations for the true unknown SI. FINDINGS: The early outbreak data largely follows the exponential growth. We estimated that the mean R0 ranges from 2.24 (95%CI: 1.96-2.55) to 3.58 (95%CI: 2.89-4.39) associated with 8-fold to 2-fold increase in the reporting rate. We demonstrated that changes in reporting rate substantially affect estimates of R0. CONCLUSION: The mean estimate of R0 for the 2019-nCoV ranges from 2.24 to 3.58, and is significantly larger than 1.

At the same time, we see non-China deaths increasing rapidly, and similar to the early behavior of the China statistics. Thus, we see three stages of the spread of the disease in terms of number of deaths: exponential growth, power-law behavior, and then exponential decline in the daily rate. (Original abstract) The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) continues to grow rapidly in China and is spreading in other parts of the world. The classic epidemiological approach in studying this growth is to quantify a reproduction number and infection time, and this is the approach followed by many studies on the epidemiology of this disease. However, this assumption leads to exponential growth, and while the growth rate is high, it is not following exponential behavior. One approach that is being used is to simply keep adjusting the reproduction number to match the dynamics. Other approaches use rate equations such as the SEIR and logistical models. Here we show that the current growth closely follows power-law kinetics, indicative of an underlying fractal or small-world network of connections between susceptible and infected individuals. Positive deviations from this growth law might indicate either a failure of the current containment efforts while negative deviations might indicate the beginnings of the end of the pandemic. We cannot predict the ultimate extent of the pandemic but can get an estimate of the growth of the disease.",,medRxiv,,,2020-02-20,2020,,,2020.02.16.20023820,"All OA; Green, Published",Preprint,"Ziff, Robert M.; Ziff, Anna L.","Ziff, Robert M.

Previous analyses estimated the basic epidemiological parameters using symptom onset dates of the confirmed cases in Wuhan and outside China.   Methods We obtained information on the 46 coronavirus cases who traveled from Wuhan before January 23 and have been subsequently confirmed in Hong Kong, Japan, Korea, Macau, Singapore, and Taiwan as of February 5, 2020. Most cases have detailed travel history and disease progress. Compared to previous analyses, an important distinction is that we used this data to informatively simulate the infection time of each case using the symptom onset time, previously reported incubation interval, and travel history. We then fitted a simple exponential growth model with adjustment for the January 23 travel ban to the distribution of the simulated infection time. We used a Bayesian analysis with diffuse priors to quantify the uncertainty of the estimated epidemiological parameters. We performed sensitivity analysis to different choices of incubation interval and the hyperparameters in the prior specification.   Results We found that our model provides good fit to the distribution of the infection time. Assuming the travel rate to the selected countries and regions is constant over the study period, we found that the epidemic was doubling in size every 2.9 days (95% credible interval [CrI], 2 days—4.1 days). Using previously reported serial interval for 2019-nCoV, the estimated basic reproduction number is 5.7 (95% CrI, 3.4—9.2). The estimates did not change substantially if we assumed the travel rate doubled in the last 3 days before January 23, when we used previously reported incubation interval for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), or when we changed the hyperparameters in our prior specification.   Conclusions Our estimated epidemiological parameters are higher than an earlier report using confirmed cases in Wuhan. This indicates the 2019-nCoV could have been spreading faster than previous estimates.",,medRxiv,,,2020-02-09,2020,,,2020.02.06.20020941,"All OA; Green, Published",Preprint,"Zhao, Qingyuan; Chen, Yang; Small, Dylan S","Zhao, Qingyuan (University of Cambridge;); Chen, Yang (University of Michigan;); Small, Dylan S (University of Pennsylvania)",,"Zhao, Qingyuan (University of Cambridge); Chen, Yang (University of Michigan); Small, Dylan S (University of Pennsylvania)",University of Pennsylvania; University of Michigan; University of Cambridge,grid.25879.31; grid.214458.e; grid.5335.0,United States; United States; United Kingdom,,8,8,,,17,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2020/02/09/2020.02.06.20020941.full.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1124769413,1117 Public Health and Health Services; 11 Medical and Health Sciences,

The 2019-nCoV cases might have been under-reported roughly from 1 to 15 January 2020, and thus we estimated the number of unreported cases and the basic reproduction number, R0, of 2019-nCoV. METHODS: We modelled the epidemic curve of 2019-nCoV cases, in mainland China from 1 December 2019 to 24 January 2020 through the exponential growth. The number of unreported cases was determined by the maximum likelihood estimation. We used the serial intervals (SI) of infection caused by two other well-known coronaviruses (CoV), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) CoVs, as approximations of the unknown SI for 2019-nCoV to estimate R0. RESULTS: We confirmed that the initial growth phase followed an exponential growth pattern. The under-reporting was likely to have resulted in 469 (95% CI: 403-540) unreported cases from 1 to 15 January 2020. The reporting rate after 17 January 2020 was likely to have increased 21-fold (95% CI: 18-25) in comparison to the situation from 1 to 17 January 2020 on average. We estimated the R0 of 2019-nCoV at 2.56 (95% CI: 2.49-2.63).

We present estimates of the basic reproduction number, R 0 , of 2019-nCoV in the early phase of the outbreak.    Methods  Accounting for the impact of the variations in disease reporting rate, we modelled the epidemic curve of 2019-nCoV cases time series, in mainland China from January 10 to January 24, 2020, through the exponential growth. With the estimated intrinsic growth rate ( γ ), we estimated R 0 by using the serial intervals (SI) of two other well-known coronavirus diseases, MERS and SARS, as approximations for the true unknown SI.    Findings  The early outbreak data largely follows the exponential growth. We estimated that the mean R 0 ranges from 2.24 (95%CI: 1.96-2.55) to 3.58 (95%CI: 2.89-4.39) associated with 8-fold to 2-fold increase in the reporting rate. We demonstrated that changes in reporting rate substantially affect estimates of R 0 .

The molecular mechanism of virus infection and spread in the body is not yet disclosed, but studies on other betacoronaviruses show that, upon cell infection, these viruses inhibit macroautophagy/autophagy flux and cause the accumulation of autophagosomes. No drug has yet been approved for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection; however, preclinical investigations suggested repurposing of several FDA-approved drugs for clinical trials. Half of these drugs are modulators of the autophagy pathway. Unexpectedly, instead of acting by directly antagonizing the effects of viruses, these drugs appear to function by suppressing autophagy flux. Based on the established cross-talk between autophagy and apoptosis, we speculate that over-accumulation of autophagosomes activates an apoptotic pathway that results in apoptotic death of the infected cells and disrupts the virus replication cycle.

Medical school administrators, students, and national governing bodies have been forced to make difficult decision as a result of public health concerns and government-enforced restrictions. We, as rising fourth-year medical students, would like to shed light upon the hard work that many of those in leadership positions have done as well as lay out some concerns that medical students who are preparing to apply to residency have. Additionally, we would like to suggest several potential approaches that attempt to address some of the problems arising from the pandemic. Continuing to balance education with the hurdles presented by COVID-19 will require a multi-faceted and coordinated approach. We believe that implementing virtual rotations, delaying the opening of the application, decentralizing clinical skills evaluations, and modifying graduation requirements are possible options among many that could aid in addressing some of the current challenges presented by COVID-19.",,Journal of Medical Education and Curricular Development,,,2020-01,2020,7,,2382120520940659,All OA; Gold,Article,"Liesman, Daniel R; Pumiglia, Luke; Kemp, Michael T; Alam, Hasan B","Liesman, Daniel R (University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.); Pumiglia, Luke (University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.); Kemp, Michael T (Department of Surgery, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.); Alam, Hasan B (Department of Surgery, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.)",,"Liesman, Daniel R (University of Michigan); Pumiglia, Luke (University of Michigan); Kemp, Michael T (University of Michigan); Alam, Hasan B (University of Michigan)",University of Michigan,grid.214458.e,United States,,1,1,,,,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/2382120520940659,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1129336068,1303 Specialist Studies In Education; 13 Education,

Objective: To identify the predictors associated with poor clinical outcomes in patients with COVID-19. Methods: Relevant articles from PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, and Web of Science were searched and extracted as of April 5, 2020. Data of interest were collected and evaluated for their compatibility for the meta-analysis. Cumulative calculations to determine the correlation and effect estimates were performed using the Z test. Results: In total, 19 papers recording 1,934 mild and 1,644 severe cases of COVID-19 were included. Based on the initial evaluation, 62 potential risk factors were identified for the meta-analysis. Several comorbidities, including chronic respiratory disease, cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension were observed more frequent among patients with severe COVID-19 than with the mild ones. Compared to the mild form, severe COVID-19 was associated with symptoms such as dyspnea, anorexia, fatigue, increased respiratory rate, and high systolic blood pressure. Lower levels of lymphocytes and hemoglobin; elevated levels of leukocytes, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, blood creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, high-sensitivity troponin, creatine kinase, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, interleukin 6, D-dimer, ferritin, lactate dehydrogenase, and procalcitonin; and a high erythrocyte sedimentation rate were also associated with severe COVID-19. Conclusion: More than 30 risk factors are associated with a higher risk of severe COVID-19. These may serve as useful baseline parameters in the development of prediction tools for COVID-19 prognosis.","We thank to Lembaga Pengelola Dana Pendidikan (LPDP) Republik Indonesia for supporting this project.

Lung injury with severe respiratory failure is the leading cause of death in COVID-19, brought by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS- CoV-2). However, there still lacks efficient treatment for COVID-19 induced lung injury and acute respiratory failure. Inhibition of Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) caused by spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 is the most plausible mechanism of lung injury in COVID-19. We propose two candidate drugs, COL-3 (a chemically modified tetracycline) and CGP-60474 (a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor), for treating lung injuries in COVID-19, based on their abilities to reverse the gene expression patterns in HCC515 cells treated with ACE2 inhibitor and in human COVID-19 patient lung tissues. Further bioinformatics analysis shows that twelve significantly enriched pathways (P-value <0.05) overlap between HCC515 cells treated with ACE2 inhibitor and human COVID-19 patient lung tissues, including signaling pathways known to be associated with lung injury such as TNF signaling, MAPK signaling and Chemokine signaling pathways. All these twelve pathways are targeted in COL-3 treated HCC515 cells, in which genes such as RHOA, RAC2, FAS, CDC42 have reduced expression. CGP-60474 shares eleven of twelve pathways with COL-3 with common target genes such as RHOA. It also uniquely targets genes related to lung injury, such as CALR and MMP14. In summary, this study shows that ACE2 inhibition is likely part of the mechanisms leading to lung injury in COVID-19, and that compounds such as COL-3 and CGP-60474 have the potential as repurposed drugs for its treatment.","This research was supported by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences through funds provided by the trans-NIH Big Data to Knowledge (BD2K) initiative [K01ES025434]; the US National Library of Medicine [R01 LM012373, R01 LM12907]; and the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development [R01 HD084633; to L.X.

As of 20 Feb 2020, a total of 2,055 medical staff confirmed with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by SARS-Cov-2 in China had been reported. We sought to explore the epidemiological, clinical characteristics and prognosis of novel coronavirus-infected medical staff. Methods: In this retrospective study, 64 confirmed cases of novel coronavirus-infected medical staff admitted to Union Hospital, Wuhan between 16 Jan, 2020 to 15 Feb, 2020 were included. Two groups concerned were extracted from the subjects based on duration of symptoms: group 1 (≤10 days) and group 2 (>10 days). Epidemiological and clinical data were analyzed and compared across groups. The Kaplan-Meier plot was used to inspect the change in hospital discharge rate. The Cox regression model was utilized to identify factors associated with hospital discharge. Findings: The median age of medical staff included was 35 years old. 64% were female and 67% were nurses. None had an exposure to Huanan seafood wholesale market or wildlife. A small proportion of the cohort had contact with specimens (5%) as well as patients in fever clinics (8%) and isolation wards (5%). Fever (67%) was the most common symptom, followed by cough (47%) and fatigue (34%). The median time interval between symptoms onset and admission was 8.5 days. On admission, 80% of medical staff showed abnormal IL-6 levels and 34% had lymphocytopenia. Chest CT mainly manifested as bilateral (61%), septal/subpleural (80%) and ground­glass (52%) opacities. During the study period, no patients was transferred to intensive care unit or died, and 34 (53%) had been discharged. Higher body mass index (BMI) (≥ 24 kg/m 2 ) (HR 0.14; 95% CI 0.03-0.73), fever (HR 0.24; 95% CI 0.09-0.60) and higher levels of IL-6 on admission (HR 0.31; 95% CI 0.11-0.87) were unfavorable factors for discharge. Interpretation: In this study, medical staff infected with COVID-19 have relatively milder symptoms and favorable clinical course, which may be partly due to their medical expertise, younger age and less underlying diseases. The potential risk factors of larger BMI, presence of fever symptoms and IL-6 levels greater than >2.9 pg/ml could help to identify novel coronavirus-infected medical staff with poor prognosis at an early stage.

30,pub.1127770346,10.1097/hn9.0000000000000026,,PMC7236843,The COVID-19 pandemic: implications for the head and neck anesthesiologist,"As the COVID-19 pandemic has unfolded, there has been growing recognition of risks to the anesthesia and surgical teams that require careful consideration to ensure optimal patient care. Airway management and other head and neck procedures risk exposure to mucosal surfaces, secretions, droplets, and aerosols that may harbor the SARS-CoV-2 virus. This review provides guidance on optimal practice approaches for performing patient evaluation and management of head and neck procedures with the shared goal of providing safe and effective patient care while minimizing the risk of viral transmission. The scientific literature was evaluated, focusing on strategies to reduce risk to health care workers involved in airway management and head and neck surgery. The search strategy involved curating consensus statements and guidelines relating to COVID-19 or prior coronavirus outbreaks in relation to aerosol-generating procedures (AGPs) and other high-risk procedures, with the search restricted to the scope of head and neck anesthesia. A multidisciplinary team analyzed the findings, using iterative virtual communications through video conference, telephone, email, and shared online documents until consensus was achieved, loosely adapted from the Delphi technique. Items without consensus were so indicated or removed from the manuscript. Health care worker infection and deaths during the COVID-19 pandemic and prior outbreaks mandate robust standards for infection control. Most head and neck anesthesiology procedures generate aerosols, and algorithms may be modified to mitigate risks. Examples include preoxygenation before induction of anesthesia, rapid sequence induction, closing circuits expeditiously, and consideration of apneic technique for surgical entry of airway. Rescue measures are also modified, with supraglottic airways elevated in the difficult airway algorithm to minimize the need for bag mask ventilation. Personal protective equipment for AGPs include fit-tested N95 mask (or purified air positive respirator), gloves, goggles, and gown for patients with known or suspected COVID-19. Meticulous donning and doffing technique, minimizing personnel and room traffic, diligent hand hygiene, and social distancing all can decrease risks. Perioperative management approaches may differ from commonly employed patterns including avoidance of techniques such as jet ventilation, high-flow nasal oxygen and instead utilizing techniques with a closed ventilatory circuit and secured endotracheal tube, minimizing open suctioning, and preventing aerosolization at emergence. Recommendations are made for the following head and neck procedures and considerations: primary airway management; high-flow nasal oxygen delivery; jet ventilation for laryngotracheal surgery; awake intubation; transnasal skull base surgery; tracheostomy; and use of personal protective equipment. COVID-19 testing may facilitate decision making, but it is currently often unavailable and urgency of surgical treatment must be considered. During pandemics, head and neck anesthesia and surgical teams have a duty to not only provide high quality patient care but also to ensure the safety of the health care team. Several specific perioperative approaches are recommended that have some variance from commonly employed practices, focusing on the reduction of AGP to minimize the risk of infection from patients with known or suspected COVID-19 infection.","The authors would like to recognize and thank Steven B.

22,pub.1128815721,10.2139/ssrn.3620818,,,Transcriptomic Signatures and Immunomodulatory Treatments for COVID-19 Patients,"Since December 2019, the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has infected over 9.0 million and led to death of over 472,000 people, damaging the world’s social and economic fabrics. Effective drugs are urgently needed to decrease the high mortality rate of COVID-19 patients. Unfortunately, effective antiviral drugs or vaccines are currently unavailable. Herein, we systematically evaluated the effect of SARS-CoV-2 on gene expression of both lung tissue and blood from COVID-19 patients using transcriptome profiling. Differential gene expression analysis revealed potential core mechanism of COVID-19-induced pneumonia in which IFN-α, IFN-β, IFN-γ, TNF and IL6 triggered cytokine storm mediated by neutrophil, macrophage, B and DC cells. Weighted gene correlation network analysis identified two gene modules that are highly correlated with clinical traits of COVID-19 patients, and confirmed that over-activation of immune system-mediated cytokine release syndrome is the underlying pathogenic mechanism for acute phase of COVID-19 infection. It suggested that anti-inflammatory therapies may be promising regimens for COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, drug repurposing analysis of thousands of drugs revealed that TNFα inhibitor etanercept and γ-aminobutyric acid-B receptor (GABABR) agonist baclofen showed most significant reversal power to COVID-19 gene signature, so we are highly optimistic about their clinical use for COVID-19 treatment. In addition, our results suggested that adalimumab, tocilizumab, rituximab and glucocorticoids may also have beneficial effects in restoring normal transcriptome, but not chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine or interferons. Controlled clinical trials of these candidate drugs are needed in search of effective COVID-19 treatment in current crisis.",,SSRN Electronic Journal,,,2020,2020,,,,"All OA; Green, Accepted & Submitted",Preprint,"Li, Guobing; Zhao, Xiaolu; Liu, Qi; Ruan, Shasha; Dou, Yali; Mao, Fengbiao","Li, Guobing (University of Michigan); Zhao, Xiaolu (University of Michigan); Liu, Qi (Harvard University - Harvard Medical School); Ruan, Shasha (Wuhan University); Dou, Yali (University of Michigan at Ann Arbor - Department of Pathology); Mao, Fengbiao (University of Michigan)",,"Li, Guobing (University of Michigan); Zhao, Xiaolu (University of Michigan); Liu, Qi (Harvard University); Ruan, Shasha (Wuhan University); Dou, Yali (University of Michigan); Mao, Fengbiao (University of Michigan)",University of Michigan; Wuhan University; Harvard University,grid.214458.e; grid.49470.3e; grid.38142.3c,United States; China; United States,,0,0,,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1128815721,11 Medical and Health Sciences; 1103 Clinical Sciences,3 Good Health and Well Being

14,pub.1131864396,10.2139/ssrn.3682096,,,Clinically Applicable Approach for Predicting Future Mechanical Ventilation in Patients with COVID-19 Infection,"Background: COVID-19 patients requiring mechanical ventilation have a high mortality and resource utilization. The ability to predict which patients may require mechanical ventilation, prior to clinical decompensation, allows increased acuity of care and targeted interventions to potentially mitigate deterioration. Methods: We included COVID-19 positive hospitalized patients in this single-center retrospective observational study. Our primary outcome was mechanical ventilation or death within the subsequent 24-hours prediction window. As clinical decompensation is likely more recognizable, but less modifiable, as the prediction window shrinks, we also assessed 4-hour and 12-hour, and, for more notice, 48-hour prediction window. General classes of model features included demographic information, laboratory results, comorbidities, medication administration, and vital signs. We created a Random Forest model and assessed performance using 10-fold cross validation. The model was then compared to models derived from generalized estimating equations using discrimination.Findings: Ninety-three (23%) of the 398 COVID-19 positive patients meeting our inclusion criteria required mechanical ventilation or died within 14-days of admission. The Random Forest model predicts pending mechanical ventilation with good discrimination (c-statistic = 0.858, 95% confidence interval 0.841 to 0.874), which is comparable to the discrimination of the generalized estimating equation regression. Vitals sign data including SpO 2 /FiO 2 ratio (Z-score = 8.56), respiratory rate (5.97), and heart rate (5.87) had the highest predictive utility in our algorithm. In our highest risk cohort, the number of patients needed to identify (NNI) a single new case of mechanical ventilation was 3.2 and for our second risk quintile, NNI was 5.0. Interpretation: Machine learning techniques can be leveraged to improve the ability to predict which COVID-19 patients are likely to require mechanical ventilation, identifying unrecognized bellwethers and providing insight into the constellation of accompanying signs of respiratory failure in COVID-19.Funding : National Institutes of Health and the Foundation for Anesthesia Education and ResearchFunding: MRM reports grants from the National Institutes of Health (K01-HL141701).

During these unprecedented times, there is an increased demand in medical and personal protective equipment (PPE). Since the supplies may take a long time to meet the global demand, reusing PPEs will help health care workers in their response to the COVID-19 pandemic. To ensure the safety and well-being of the medical first responders, PPE needs to be sterilized before reuse. In this review, we examine various sterilization techniques that can be used to sterilize PPEs and point out its limitations. The objective is to provide a foundation of knowledge incorporating different sterilization techniques that allow hospitals and clinics to pick the most suitable technique for sterilization of a particular PPE.","This work was supported by the U.S. Department of Energy, National Nuclear Security Administration under Grant DE-NA0003920.",IEEE Access,,,2020,2020,8,,111347-111354,All OA; Gold,Article,"Jinia, Abbas Johar; Sunbul, Noora Ba; Meert, Christopher A.; Miller, Cameron A.; Clarke, Shaun D.; Kearfott, Kimberlee J.; Matuszak, Martha M.; Pozzi, Sara A.","Jinia, Abbas Johar (Department of Nuclear Engineering and Radiological Sciences, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109-2104, USA); Sunbul, Noora Ba (Department of Nuclear Engineering and Radiological Sciences, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109-2104, USA); Meert, Christopher A.

To address the challenges posed by COVID-19, the links among the transmission of COVID-19, socio-economic factors and climatic factors must be understood to suggest better strategies for predicting, preventing, coping with and mitigating the associated challenges. We aimed to describe the spatial distribution of the COVID-19 pandemic worldwide and assess the effects of various socio-ecological factors, including climate and socio-economic factors, on COVID-19 risk.Methods: We collected COVID-19 pandemic infection data of 178 countries/regions worldwide from the 2019 Novel Coronavirus Visual Dashboard data repository, operated by the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU-CSSE), and collected socio-ecological data from the Global Surface Summary of the Day (GSOD) and World Development Indicators dataset. We established the Potential Risk Assessment Framework for COVID-19. We used spatial econometrics method to assess the global and local correlation of COVID-19 risk indicators (the incidence rate, cumulative mortality rate and daily cumulative index) for COVID-19. To estimate the adjusted IRR, we modelled negative binomial regression analysis with spatial information and socio-ecological factors.Findings: By April 6, 2020, 178 cases were reported globally. The test results for local spatial correlations indicated that 37, 29 and 39 countries/regions were strongly opposite from the IR, CMR and DCI index ""spatial autocorrelation hypothesis"", respectively. The IRs were significantly positively associated with GDP per capita, the use of at least basic sanitation services and social insurance program coverage, and were significantly negatively associated with the proportion of the population spending more than 25% of household consumption or income on out-of-pocket health care expenses and the poverty headcount ratio at the national poverty lines. The CMR was significantly positively associated with urban populations, GDP per capita and current health expenditure, and was significantly negatively associated with the number of hospital beds, number of nurses and midwives, and poverty headcount ratio at the national poverty lines. The DCI was significantly positively associated with urban populations, population density and researchers in R&D, and was significantly negatively associated with the number of hospital beds, number of nurses and midwives and poverty headcount ratio at the national poverty lines. We also found that climatic factors (temperature, relative humidity, precipitation and wind speed) did not significantly reduce COVID-19 risk.Interpretation: Attention must be paid to the similarities in COVID-19 transmission characteristics (such as transmission speed and mortality rate) across countries/regions, and national/regional early warning and protection measures must be successfully implemented. Governmental regulation of social and economic factors is particularly important to reduce COVID-19 risk. To fight against COVID-19 more effectively, countries/regions should pay more attention to controlling population flow, improving diagnosis and treatment capacity, and improving public welfare policies.Funding Statement: National Natural Science Foundation of China, Michigan Institute for Clinical and Health Research.Declaration of Interests: DS, YC, MT and YZ are funded by National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 71473096; No. 71673101; No. 71974066).

The State of Michigan reports over 80,000 positive COVID-19 tests between March 1, 2020 until July 29, 2020.Methods: We surveyed 8,047 Michigan Medicine biorepository participants in late June 2020 to evaluate diagnoses of COVID-19 (N=133), symptoms, exposure, and clinical risk factors as well as the impact on health behaviors and level of concern.Results: Based on survey results, we found that 58% of COVID-19 cases reported no known exposure to family members or to someone outside the house diagnosed with COVID-19. A significantly higher rate of COVID-19 cases were employed as essential workers (45% vs 19%, p=3x10 -11). COVID-19 cases reporting a fever were more likely to require hospitalization (categorized as severe; OR = 4.6 [95% CI: 1.7-13.0, p=0.004]) whereas respondents reporting rhinorrhea was less likely to require hospitalization (categorized as mild-to-moderate; OR = 0.16 [95% CI: 0.04-0.70, p=0.016]). African-Americans reported higher rates of being diagnosed with COVID-19 (OR = 4.0 [95% CI: 2.2-7.2, p=1x10-4]), as well as higher rates of an annual household income < $40,000, living in rental housing, exposure to family or someone outside the household diagnosed with COVID-19, and chronic diseases. During the Executive Order in Michigan, African Americans, women, and the lowest income group reported worsening health behaviors and higher overall concern for the potential detrimental effects of the pandemic.Interpretation: The higher risk of contracting COVID-19 observed among African Americans may be due to the increased rates of working as essential employees, lower socioeconomic status, and exposure to known positive cases. Continued efforts should focus on COVID-19 prevention and mitigation strategies, as well as address the inequality gaps that result in higher risks for both short-term and long-term health outcomes.Funding Statement: Dr. Willer is supported by National Institutes of Health grants R35-HL135824, R01- HL142023, R01-DK075787, and R01-HL109946 Dr. Douville is supported by the Foundation for Anesthesia Education and Research (FAER) - Mentored Research Training Grant.

11,pub.1125953794,10.2139/ssrn.3562070,,,COVID-19 Evolves in Human Hosts,"Today, we are all threatened by an unprecedented pandemic: COVID-19. How different is it from other coronaviruses? Will it be attenuated or become more virulent? Which animals may be its original host? In this study, we analyzed 377 publicly available complete genome sequences for the COVID-19 virus, the previously known flu-causing coronaviruses (HCov-229E, HCov-OC43, HCov-NL63 and HCov-HKU1) and the lethal, pathogenic P3/P4 viruses, SARS, MERS, Victoria, Lassa, Yamagata, Ebola, and Dengue. We found strong similarities between the current circulating COVID-19 and SARS and MERS, as well as COVID-19 in rhinolophines and pangolins. On the contrary, COVID-19 shares little similarity with the flu-causing coronaviruses and the other P3/P4 viruses. Strikingly, we observed divergence of COVID-19 strains isolated from human hosts has steadily increased from December 2019 to March 2020, suggesting COVID-19 is actively evolving in human hosts. From all existing human COVID-19 genome sequences, we calculated the first common model that represents the shared sequences of the human COVID-19 strains, which provides important information for vaccine and antibody development. Geographic and timecourse analysis of the evolutionary trees of the human COVID-19 reveals possibly heterogeneous evolutional paths among strains from 21 countries. This finding has important implications to the management of COVID-19 and the development of vaccines.",,SSRN Electronic Journal,,,2020,2020,,,,"All OA; Green, Accepted & Submitted",Preprint,"Li, Yanni; Liu, Bing; Cui, Jiangtao; Wang, Zhi; Shen, Yulong; Xu, Yueshen; Yao, Kaicheng; Guan, Yuanfang","Li, Yanni (Xidian University - School of Computer Science and Technology); Liu, Bing (Peking University); Cui, Jiangtao (Xidian University); Wang, Zhi (Xidian University - School of Computer Science and Technology); Shen, Yulong (Xidian University); Xu, Yueshen (Xidian University); Yao, Kaicheng (Xidian University); Guan, Yuanfang (University of Michigan at Ann Arbor - Department of Computational Medicine and Bioinformatics)",,"Li, Yanni (Xidian University); Liu, Bing (Peking University); Cui, Jiangtao (Xidian University); Wang, Zhi (Xidian University); Shen, Yulong (Xidian University); Xu, Yueshen (Xidian University); Yao, Kaicheng (Xidian University); Guan, Yuanfang (University of Michigan)",University of Michigan; Peking University; Xidian University,grid.214458.e; grid.11135.37; grid.440736.2,United States; China; China,,0,0,,,,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.05580,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1125953794,1108 Medical Microbiology; 11 Medical and Health Sciences,3 Good Health and Well Being
11,pub.1129666203,10.2139/ssrn.3656789,,,The Personal Responsibility Pandemic: Centering Solidarity in Public Health and Employment Law,"The personal responsibility ethos that has driven the US response to the coronavirus pandemic has been ineffective, atomizing, and unjust. Restrictions on public services and private activities have disproportionately burdened people living in low-income households, people with disabilities, people of color, and women. At the same time, the severe illnesses and deaths that have continued to occur in spite of public health responses have been disproportionately concentrated among people of color, disabled people, and low-wage workers. This paper argues that fundamentally individualistic employment and antidiscrimination laws have undermined—rather than supported—disempowered workers’ ability to protect themselves and others. The law has failed to protect people who live and work in congregate institutions (including nursing homes, prisons, jails, detention facilities, factories, and warehouses . . . and, perhaps soon, schools) and thus has failed to protect the broader communities with which these institutions are interconnected. Together, public health and employment laws have put the onus on individuals to adopt protective behaviors without providing them with the supports, accommodations, and protections they need to do so. We identify three key areas for reform to ensure more effective and just pandemic response—for this pandemic and the next one—built on a core commitment to social solidarity in public health law and employment and antidiscrimination law. First, public health law should prioritize supports that create the conditions required mitigate the spread of infection over punitive measures targeting individuals. Second, employment law should protect workers from infection, including through workplace safety, privacy, and antidiscrimination protections that enable them to adopt protective health behaviors. Third, for individuals for whom returning to work would be especially unsafe—whether because their employers maintain particularly dangerous conditions or because of their own, or their family members’, underlying health conditions—employment law should remove any obligation to return to work while the special dangers associated with the pandemic persist. In addition to making concrete proposals for reform, our argument contributes to the academic literature in both public health and employment law. First, we show that a broad vision of public health law that encompasses action on the social determinants of health in “non-health” sectors such as employment and antidiscrimination law is not only tenable, but essential. The US experience with the coronavirus pandemic puts the final nail in the coffin of the “old” public health, which its cramped focus on microbial and behavioral interventions. Second, we bring to the foreground an additional justification for employment and antidiscrimination law—to promote solidarity by ensuring that the burdens and benefits of measures that serve the public as a whole are shared equitably. Social solidarity may offer a useful way of understanding the application of these bodies of law in other health-related contexts as well, such as genetic discrimination and workplace injuries. Third, we show that the attribution of fault and responsibility is a persistent obsession of employment and antidiscrimination law. These points should be of broad interest to employment and public health law scholars alike.",,SSRN Electronic Journal,,,2020,2020,,,,"All OA; Green, Accepted & Submitted",Preprint,"Wiley, Lindsay F.; Bagenstos, Samuel R.","Wiley, Lindsay F.

Such collaboration needs open research practices and the sharing of research outputs, such as data and code, thereby facilitating research and research reproducibility and timely collaboration beyond borders. The Research Data Alliance COVID-19 Working Group recently published a set of recommendations and guidelines on data sharing and related best practices for COVID-19 research. These guidelines include recommendations for researchers, policymakers, funders, publishers and infrastructure providers from the perspective of different domains (Clinical Medicine, Omics, Epidemiology, Social Sciences, Community Participation, Indigenous Peoples, Research Software, Legal and Ethical Considerations). Several overarching themes have emerged from this document such as the need to balance the creation of data adherent to FAIR principles (findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable), with the need for quick data release; the use of trustworthy research data repositories; the use of well-annotated data with meaningful metadata; and practices of documenting methods and software. The resulting document marks an unprecedented cross-disciplinary, cross-sectoral, and cross-jurisdictional effort authored by over 160 experts from around the globe. This letter summarises key points of the Recommendations and Guidelines, highlights the relevant findings, shines a spotlight on the process, and suggests how these developments can be leveraged by the wider scientific community.","The Research Data Alliance has been supported through a grant from the Open Research division of Wellcome.

We report the emergency use of immunomodulatory therapy utilizing an extracorporeal selective cytopheretic device (SCD) in two patients with elevated serum interleukin (IL)-6 levels and refractory COVID-19 ARDS requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). The two patients were selected based on clinical criteria and elevated levels of IL-6 (>100 pg/ml) as a biomarker of inflammation. Once identified, emergency/expanded use permission for SCD treatment was obtained and patient consented. Six COVID-19 patients (four on ECMO) with severe ARDS were also screened with IL-6 levels less than 100 pg/ml and were not treated with SCD. The two enrolled patients' PaO2/FiO2 ratios increased from 55 and 58 to 200 and 192 at 52 and 50 hours, respectively. Inflammatory indices also declined with IL-6 falling from 231 and 598 pg/ml to 3.32 and 116 pg/ml, respectively. IL-6/IL-10 ratios also decreased from 11.8 and 18 to 0.7 and 0.62, respectively. The two patients were successfully weaned off ECMO after 17 and 16 days of SCD therapy, respectively. The results observed with SCD therapy on these two critically ill COVID-19 patients with severe ARDS and elevated IL-6 is encouraging.

6,pub.1131549205,10.1109/access.2020.3029558,,,Safety-Critical Control of Active Interventions for COVID-19 Mitigation,"The world has recently undergone the most ambitious mitigation effort in a century, consisting of wide-spread quarantines aimed at preventing the spread of COVID-19. The use of influential epidemiological models of COVID-19 helped to encourage decision makers to take drastic non-pharmaceutical interventions. Yet, inherent in these models are often assumptions that the active interventions are static, e.g., that social distancing is enforced until infections are minimized, which can lead to inaccurate predictions that are ever evolving as new data is assimilated. We present a methodology to dynamically guide the active intervention by shifting the focus from viewing epidemiological models as systems that evolve in autonomous fashion to control systems with an “input” that can be varied in time in order to change the evolution of the system. We show that a safety-critical control approach to COVID-19 mitigation gives active intervention policies that formally guarantee the safe evolution of compartmental epidemiological models. This perspective is applied to current US data on cases while taking into account reduction of mobility, and we find that it accurately describes the current trends when time delays associated with incubation and testing are incorporated. Optimal active intervention policies are synthesized to determine future mitigations necessary to bound infections, hospitalizations, and death, both at national and state levels. We therefore provide means in which to model and modulate active interventions with a view toward the phased reopenings that are currently beginning across the US and the world in a decentralized fashion. This framework can be converted into public policies, accounting for the fractured landscape of COVID-19 mitigation in a safety-critical fashion.","This work was supported in part by the National Science Foundation, Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) Award 1932091.

3,pub.1129936068,10.2139/ssrn.3627326,,,Alarming Mental Health Status Among Hong Kong Residents During the COVID-19 Epidemic: Role of Loneliness,"Background: Despite ongoing concerns about mental health during the COVID-19, there is lack of data on the psychiatric consequences in the general population. Public health strategies to curb the spread of the coronavirus involve sheltering at home and social distancing have been effective in reducing the transmission rate, but the unintended consequences of prolonged social isolation on mental health has not been investigated. Methods: We conducted an anonymous online survey of residents in Hong Kong. We focused on Hong Kong for its very rapid and comprehensive response to the pandemic and strictly enacted social distancing protocols. Thus, Hong Kong is a model case for the population-wide practice of effective social distancing and provides an opportunity to examine the impact of loneliness on mental health during the COVID-19. Outcomes: The result of this online survey indicates a dire situation with respect to mental health. An astonishing 65.6% of the respondents reported clinical levels of depression, anxiety, and/or stress. Moreover, 22.5% of the respondents were showing signs of psychosis-risk. Increased levels of psychiatric symptoms were explained by feelings of loneliness. Interpretation: To mitigate the potential epidemic of mental illness in the near future, there is an urgent need to prepare clinicians, caregivers and stakeholders to focus on loneliness. Although the sociopolitical situation of Hong Kong prior to the pandemic was likely another exacerbating factor, given that sociopolitical unrest and violence are common, global problems that co-exist with the pandemic, the case of Hong Kong may prove to be prescient.Funding Statement: None.Declaration of Interests: The authors report no conflicts of interests pertinent to this study.Ethics Approval Statement: This study received exempt determination from the University of Michigan Institutional Review Board (IRB# HUM00179454).",,SSRN Electronic Journal,,,2020,2020,,,,"All OA; Green, Accepted & Submitted",Preprint,"Tso, Ivy; Park, Sohee","Tso, Ivy (University of Michigan at Ann Arbor - Department of Psychiatry); Park, Sohee (Department of Psychology, Vanderbilt University)",,"Tso, Ivy (University of Michigan); Park, Sohee (Vanderbilt University)",Vanderbilt University; University of Michigan,grid.152326.1; grid.214458.e,United States; United States,,0,0,,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1129936068,1117 Public Health and Health Services; 11 Medical and Health Sciences,"16 Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions"

2,pub.1128881325,10.2139/ssrn.3633443,,,A Macroeconomic SIR Model for COVID-19,"The current COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent lockdowns have highlighted the close and delicate relationship between a country's public health and economic health. Macroeconomic models which use preexisting epidemic models to calculate the impacts of a disease outbreak are therefore extremely useful for policymakers seeking to evaluate the best course of action in such a crisis. We develop an SIR model of the COVID-19 pandemic which explicitly considers herd immunity, behavior-dependent transmission rates, remote workers, and indirect externalities of lockdown. This model is presented as an exit time control problem where the lockdown ends when the population achieves herd immunity, either naturally or via a vaccine. A social planner prescribes separate levels of lockdown for two separate sections of the adult population - those who are low-risk (ages 20-64) and those who are high-risk (ages 65 and over). These levels are determined via optimization of an objective function which assigns a macroeconomic cost to the level of lockdown and the number of deaths. We find that, by ending lockdowns once herd immunity is reached, high-risk individuals are able to leave lockdown significantly before the arrival of a vaccine without causing large increases in mortality. Additionally, if we incorporate a behavior-dependent transmission rate which represents increased personal caution in response to increased infection levels, both output loss and total mortality are lowered. Lockdown efficacy is further increased when there is less interaction between low- and high-risk individuals, and increased remote work decreases output losses. Overall, our model predicts that a lockdown which ends at the arrival of herd immunity, combined with individual actions to slow virus transmission, can reduce total mortality to one-third of the no-lockdown level, while allowing high-risk individuals to leave lockdown well before vaccine arrival.",,SSRN Electronic Journal,,,2020,2020,,,,"All OA; Green, Accepted & Submitted",Preprint,"Bayraktar, Erhan; Cohen, Asaf; Nellis, April","Bayraktar, Erhan (University of Michigan at Ann Arbor - Department of Mathematics); Cohen, Asaf (University of Michigan at Ann arbor - Department of Mathematics); Nellis, April (University of Michigan)",,"Bayraktar, Erhan (University of Michigan); Cohen, Asaf (University of Michigan); Nellis, April (University of Michigan)",University of Michigan,grid.214458.e,United States,,0,0,,,,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.16389,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1128881325,1117 Public Health and Health Services; 11 Medical and Health Sciences,3 Good Health and Well Being

This manuscript draws upon economic estimates of mortality induced by government regulation, to compare lives saved by the current public health approach with potential downstream collateral loss of life from the economic downturn. The lives-to-lives comparison is free of bias from differences in people’s normative assessments of the value of human life. Based on the best currently available evidence, we estimate that, by the end of 2020, COVID-19-mitigating public health measures will save between 450,000 and 2,700,000 lives in the US; however, the economic downturn from shelter-in-place measures and other restrictions on economic activity could create a downstream collateral loss of 50,400-323,000 lives over the following years. This manuscript concludes that COVID-19-mitigating public health measures are justified; however they can create potentially significant, albeit less overt, downstream mortality. A balanced approach that prioritizes public health while also restricting economic activity as minimally as possible is essential to emerging from the pandemic with the least amount of humanitarian cost from the virus and from the loss of economic opportunity combined.",,SSRN Electronic Journal,,,2020,2020,,,,"All OA; Green, Accepted & Submitted",Preprint,"Yakusheva, Olga; van den Broek-Altenburg, Eline; Brekke, Gayle; Atherly, Adam","Yakusheva, Olga (University of Michigan, Ann Arbor); van den Broek-Altenburg, Eline (University of Vermont - Larner College of Medicine); Brekke, Gayle (University of Kansas - School of Medicine); Atherly, Adam ()",,"Yakusheva, Olga (University of Michigan); van den Broek-Altenburg, Eline (University of Vermont); Brekke, Gayle (University of Kansas); Atherly, Adam ()",University of Vermont; University of Kansas; University of Michigan,grid.59062.38; grid.266515.3; grid.214458.e,United States; United States; United States,,0,0,,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1128974028,1117 Public Health and Health Services; 11 Medical and Health Sciences,3 Good Health and Well Being

In this paper, we show that states’ efforts to contain COVID-19 infections through statewide emergency declarations, Stay at Home orders, and phased reopening have significantly altered prevailing patterns of firearm injuries and deaths. We provide a systematic analysis of how state policy responses to COVID-19 affected overall levels of gun violence and specific kinds of shootings, including multiple victim and mass shootings. While emergency declarations and Stay at Home orders had a dampening effect on many forms of gun violence, we find that the number of people injured or killed by a firearm per day increased more than 15% following state reopening, on average. Over the first 30 days of reopening, we estimate that the average state had an additional 5 mass shootings than would be predicted absent the epidemic in the first 30 days of reopening. Additionally, we examine how COVID-related public health measures affect the composition of gun violence. We find that gun violence has followed workers and children home; even though workplaces and schools have closed, gun violence has likely reappeared in Americans’ lives as domestic violence related shootings and child involved shootings during Stay at Home and school closure periods. Finally, we show that state gun laws worked together with COVID-related emergency declarations and Stay at Home orders to further decrease gun violence in some states. Conversely, in states with decreased criminal liability for firearm use, as in states with Stand Your Ground laws, we observe an exacerbating effect on firearm injuries and deaths during the emergency declaration and Stay at Home order periods. Only one policy, waiting periods for handgun purchases, significantly dampened reopening surges in gun violence. These findings suggest that state policy environments can substantially reduce the impacts of exogenous shocks like COVID-19 on American gun violence and provides guidance on which policies can be helpful and which can be harmful.",,SSRN Electronic Journal,,,2020,2020,,,,"All OA; Green, Accepted & Submitted",Preprint,"McKay, Tara; Metzl, Jonathan; Piemonte, Jennifer","McKay, Tara (Vanderbilt University); Metzl, Jonathan (Vanderbilt University - Center for Medicine, Health, and Society); Piemonte, Jennifer (University of Michigan)",,"McKay, Tara (Vanderbilt University); Metzl, Jonathan (Vanderbilt University); Piemonte, Jennifer (University of Michigan)",University of Michigan; Vanderbilt University,grid.214458.e; grid.152326.1,United States; United States,,0,0,,,7,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1130448421,1117 Public Health and Health Services; 11 Medical and Health Sciences,"16 Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions"

However, macroeconomic projections are likely to be a poor guide to individual and household welfare in a fast-moving crisis that has involved disruption to an unusually wide range of sectors and livelihoods. To explore the impacts of COVID-19 disruptions on household poverty and coping strategies, as well as maternal food insecurity experiences, this study used a telephone survey conducted in June and July 2020 covering 2,017 mothers of nutritionally vulnerable young children in urban Yangon and rural villages of Myanmar’s Dry Zone.Stratifying results by location, livelihoods, and asset-levels, and using retrospective questions on pre-COVID-19 incomes and various COVID-19 impacts, we find that the vast majority of households have been adversely affected from loss of income and employment. Over three-quarters cite income/job losses as the main impact of COVID-19 – median incomes declined by one third and $1.90/day income-based poverty rose by around 27 percentage points between January and June 2020. Falling into poverty was most strongly associated with loss of employment (including migrant employment), but also with recent childbirth. The poor commonly coped with income losses through taking loans/credit, while better-off households drew down on savings and reduced non-food expenditures. Self-reported food insecurity experiences were much more common in the urban sample than in the rural sample, even though income-based and asset-based poverty were more prevalent in rural areas. In urban areas, around one quarter of respondents were worried about food quantities and quality, and around 10 percent stated that there were times when they had run out of food or gone hungry. Respondents who stated that their household had lost income or experienced food supply problems due to COVID-19 were more likely to report a variety of different food insecurity experiences.These results raise the concern that the welfare impacts of the COVID-19 crisis are much more serious and widespread than macroeconomic projections would suggest. Loss of employment and casual labor are major drivers of increasing poverty. Consequently, economic recovery strategies must emphasize job creation to revitalize damaged livelihoods. However, a strengthened social protection strategy should also be a critical component of economic recovery to prevent adversely affected households from falling into poverty traps and to avert the worst forms of food insecurity and malnutrition, particularly among households with pregnant women and young children. The recent second wave of COVID-19 infections in Myanmar from mid-August onwards makes the expansion of social protection even more imperative.",,SSRN Electronic Journal,,,2020,2020,,,,"All OA; Green, Accepted & Submitted",Preprint,"Headey, Derek; Goudet, Sophie; Lambrecht, Isabel; Oo, Than Zaw; Maffioli, Elisa Maria; Toth, Russell","Headey, Derek (CGIAR - Poverty, Health and Nutrition Division); Goudet, Sophie (Independent); Lambrecht, Isabel (International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI)); Oo, Than Zaw (International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI)); Maffioli, Elisa Maria (University of Michigan at Ann Arbor - School of Public Health); Toth, Russell (School of Economics, University of Sydney)",,"Headey, Derek (); Goudet, Sophie (); Lambrecht, Isabel (); Oo, Than Zaw (); Maffioli, Elisa Maria (University of Michigan); Toth, Russell (University of Sydney)",University of Sydney; University of Michigan,grid.1013.3; grid.214458.e,Australia; United States,,0,0,,,,https://www.ifpri.org/cdmref/p15738coll2/id/134036/filename/134245.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1131635352,1403 Econometrics; 1402 Applied Economics; 14 Economics,8 Decent Work and Economic Growth; 2 Zero Hunger; 1 No Poverty

How do government responses to Covid-19 violate democratic standards? How do such violations relate to the countries’ success in limiting the Covid-19 death tolls? We propose a novel conceptualization of which government responses to Covid-19 qualify as a violation of democratic standards and measure such violations using a regularly updated dataset covering 143 countries from March 2020 onward. Our data track seven types of violations of democratic standards for emergency measures during the Covid-19 pandemic: discriminatory measures, derogation of non-derogable rights, abusive enforcement, no time limit on emergency measures, disproportionate limitations on the role of the legislature, official disinformation campaigns, and restrictions on media freedoms. In this article, we provide a comprehensive overview of the extent to which governments have violated democratic standards in their response to Covid-19. Using a regression analysis, we find no relationship between violations of democratic standards for emergency measures and Covid-19 death rates. Thus, violations of democratic standards during the Covid-19 pandemic cannot be justified by the achievement of better public health outcomes.

Combining data on beliefs about the origin of the 2014 Ebola outbreak in Liberia with conventional and machine learning methods, we uncover that, contrary to popular beliefs, socio-demographic and economic indicators play a minor role in predicting who is more likely to believe false information about the origin of the epidemic. Conspiracy theorists are not any poorer, older, less educated, more economically distressed, more rural, or ethnically different than individuals who are correctly informed. They are, however, significantly more likely to report high levels of distrust, especially towards governmental institutions. Using a regression discontinuity design, we find that access to cell phone coverage can play a key role in belief-updating: individuals with coverage are 7 percentage points more likely to switch from misinformed to informed by the end of the epidemic.

These independent constitutional rights can be in harmony in some cases and clash in others. They cannot be incompatible. Public interest in criminal justice transparency is increasingly crystallized, but courts have often become more opaque, which jeopardizes First and Sixth Amendment rights. This paper addresses the conflict and confronts a key question: how can we be assured that remote and virtual hearings like Zoom arraignments or trials guarantee the same rights as traditional court hearings? Instead of rejecting virtual criminal hearings outright, new proposals are offered for how virtual courtrooms can safeguard constitutional rights. The prevailing belief that criminal defendants should reject virtual trials is questioned. Virtual trials may lead to better outcomes for defendants than traditional trials, specifically during the ongoing pandemic. Beyond preserving rights in a virtual courtroom, the ways technology can improve the criminal justice system are explored. Through an analysis of existing indigent defense and First Amendment scholarship, the myth that traditional court decorum should trump open court and virtual hearings is addressed. Judicial legitimacy and transparency may benefit when criminal cases are accessible on virtual platforms or livestreamed. Transparency can help safeguard defendants’s rights and improve indigent clients’s representation and outcomes. Instead of disrupting the courtroom—whether a hearing is virtual or traditional—convenient public access helps a community learn more about the criminal justice system and evaluate cases, judges, and attorneys. These proposals have significant implications for courts and clients by providing a framework for virtual litigation, and leveraging technology for a more equitable criminal justice system. Livestreams and virtual, remote hearings can improve the right of representation for indigent defendants by increasing access to quality counsel, reducing costs, creating a more competitive legal market, and expanding a client’s choice of attorneys.",,SSRN Electronic Journal,,,2020,2020,,,,"All OA; Green, Accepted & Submitted",Preprint,"Bender, Matt","Bender, Matt (University of Arkansas Law School; University of Michigan Law School)",,"Bender, Matt (University of Michigan)",University of Michigan,grid.214458.e,United States,,0,0,,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1130126013,18 Law and Legal Studies; 1801 Law,"16 Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions"

All over the world, governments are borrowing and spending at a pace not seen since World War II, and at the same time revenues from both income and consumption taxes are falling because of pandemic related slowdowns in economic activity. The result is unprecedented levels of debt that even with low interest rates mean inevitable needs for more revenue down the road. Even a country that borrows in its own currency like the US or Japan cannot incur debt well in excess of GDP forever without risking either inflation (if it creates money to pay off the debt) or a sharp increase in borrowing costs that crowds out other government expenditures at a time when they are most needed to bolster the social safety net, which the pandemic revealed to be quite fragile in many countries including the US. What kind of revenue sources are we talking about? Here we need to distinguish among short, medium and long-term solutions. In the short term (1-5 years), governments need to rely on immediate solutions like excess profit taxes (EPTs) on companies that benefit from the pandemic and digital services taxes (DSTs) to capture some of the increase in the use of such services that may escape regular income and consumption taxes. In the medium term (5-10 years), governments should permanently increase taxes on the rich and on corporations to address the inequality that is likely to be exacerbated by the pandemic, and adopt carbon taxes to mitigate climate change. In the long term (10 years and more), new and innovative sources of revenue may emerge like taxes on artificial intelligence, bit taxes, financial transaction taxes and others.

0,pub.1125903809,10.2139/ssrn.3559926,,,May Hospitals Withhold Ventilators from COVID-19 Patients with Pre-Existing Disabilities? Notes on the Law and Ethics of Disability-Based Medical Rationing,"Thanks to the coronavirus pandemic, the threat of medical rationing is now clear and present. Hospitals faced with a crush of patients must now seriously confront questions of how to allocate scarce resources—notably life-saving ventilators—at a time of severe shortage. In their protocols for addressing this situation, hospitals and state agencies often employ explicitly disability-based distinctions. For example, Alabama’s crisis standards of care provide that “people with severe or profound intellectual disability ‘are unlikely candidates for ventilator support.’”This essay, written as this crisis unfolds, argues that disability-based distinctions like these violate the law. The Americans with Disabilities Act, the Rehabilitation Act, and the Affordable Care Act all prohibit health care providers from discriminating against qualified individuals with disabilities because of their disabilities. The explicit discrimination embodied in numerous state policies on its face violates these prohibitions. Nor can medical providers simply define disabled patients as being “unqualified” because of disabilities that do not affect the ability to ameliorate the condition for which treatment is sought. Longstanding and authoritative interpretations of the law bar the use of such circular techniques to insulate disability discrimination from legal challenge. Although a proper interpretation of the law may permit medical providers to use disability as a basis for a rationing decision where an individual’s underlying disability will kill the individual in the immediate term regardless of the treatment, those circumstances will be narrow. And a proper interpretation of the law requires assurances that such imminent-death determinations will be made based on the best available objective evidence, free from bias against people with disabilities or devaluation of their lives.Medical providers retain substantial discretion to make resource allocation decisions in a time of triage. They may make decisions based on non-disability factors. And where those factors do not dictate a decision, they may employ a lottery process. Such a process is more fair and democratically legitimate than placing the burden on disabled individuals—individuals who already experience disadvantage as a result of societal discrimination, and who disproportionately lack access to the political processes that frame policies concerning medical rationing.",,SSRN Electronic Journal,,,2020,2020,,,,"All OA; Green, Accepted & Submitted",Preprint,"Bagenstos, Samuel R.","Bagenstos, Samuel R.

Axonopathies are important medical entities in their own right, but in addition, illnesses once considered primary neuronopathies are now thought to begin with axonal degeneration. These disorders include Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and motor neuron diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Moreover, conditional knockout of NTE in the mouse CNS produces vacuolation and other degenerative changes in large neurons in the hippocampus, thalamus, and cerebellum, along with degeneration and swelling of axons in ascending and descending spinal cord tracts. In humans, NTE mutations cause a variety of neurodegenerative conditions resulting in a range of deficits including spastic paraplegia and blindness. Mutations in the Drosophila NTE orthologue SwissCheese (SWS) produce neurodegeneration characterized by vacuolization that can be partially rescued by expression of wild-type human NTE, suggesting a potential therapeutic approach for certain human neurological disorders. This chapter defines NTE and OPIDN, presents an overview of OP compounds, provides a rationale for NTE research, and traces the history of discovery of NTE and its relationship to OPIDN. It then briefly describes subsequent studies of NTE, including practical applications of the assay; aspects of its domain structure, subcellular localization, and tissue expression; abnormalities associated with NTE mutations, knockdown, and conventional or conditional knockout; and hypothetical models to help guide future research on elucidating the role of NTE in OPIDN.",,Advances in Neurotoxicology,Neurotoxicity of Pesticides,,2020,2020,4,,1-78,"All OA; Green, Published",Chapter,"Richardson, Rudy J.; Fink, John K.; Glynn, Paul; Hufnagel, Robert B.; Makhaeva, Galina F.; Wijeyesakere, Sanjeeva J.","Richardson, Rudy J.

We first estimate that an election in which no party achieves a parliamentary majority causes the debt-to-GDP ratio to increase by 21 percentage points over the following five years relative to an election in which one party barely secures a majority. We next estimate that real interest rates rise by a relative 119 basis points following such an election, implying that a one percentage point increase in the debt-to-GDP ratio causes a 5.6 basis point increase in real rates. That effect is larger than most previous estimates in the literature, suggesting the potential importance of simultaneity in the determination of real rates and government debt levels.",,SSRN Electronic Journal,,,2020,2020,,,,"All OA; Green, Accepted & Submitted",Preprint,"Ehrlich, Gabriel; Thapar, Aditi","Ehrlich, Gabriel (University of Michigan at Ann Arbor); Thapar, Aditi (University of Michigan at Ann Arbor)",,"Ehrlich, Gabriel (University of Michigan); Thapar, Aditi (University of Michigan)",University of Michigan,grid.214458.e,United States,,0,0,,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1128444218,1606 Political Science; 16 Studies in Human Society,8 Decent Work and Economic Growth

The decision exemplifies the difficulties that the government faces to block a merger even in relatively concentrated markets. Commentators have observed that the existing burden of proof requiring the government to prove plausibility of harm to markets even in concentrated markets will eventually dissuade challenges to vertical mergers. As a reaction, commentators have suggested that the burden of proof should be reversed on to the parties. The paper provides a historical insight on the competitively neutral attitude towards vertical mergers and a pithy substance of the recommendations to make vertical merger enforcement in line with horizontal mergers. The objective of the paper is to weave the contours of a vertical merger review regime based on a review of the ideas of the past and present.",,SSRN Electronic Journal,,,2020,2020,,,,"All OA; Green, Accepted & Submitted",Preprint,"Ramesh, Krithika","Ramesh, Krithika (University of Michigan Law School)",,"Ramesh, Krithika (University of Michigan)",University of Michigan,grid.214458.e,United States,,0,0,,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1129559857,1402 Applied Economics; 14 Economics,

Indeed, there are many comorbidities and risk factors that predispose a patient to develop pediatric ARDS (PARDS) including, but not limited to, immunodeficiency, weight extremes, genetics, and environmental factors. These are particularly important to investigators because accurate prediction of which patients are at greatest risk of PARDS – both the development of PARDS and worse clinical outcomes after PARDS has been established – is key to identifying the next generation of diagnostic techniques and preventative strategies. In addition to those risk factors, there are specific disease processes that lead to the development of PARDS, often divided into direct or pulmonary insults and indirect or extrapulmonary insults. Finally, beyond the clinically visible risk factors, researchers are attempting to identify novel biomarkers to uncover hidden phenotypes of PARDS and enrich the prognostication and prediction of patient outcomes.

This course is designed to use the quadcopter drone as an example to teach knowledge in manufacturing processes and systems, illustrate potential impacts of manufacturing to society, and stimulate learning in innovation, teamwork, and communication in a real-world engineering environment. It is also designed to teach students how to best communicate their findings and conclusions. This course is built on two team-based projects. Students practiced and timed the assembly of a state-of-the-art drone, the DJI Spark, and created a mid-term project presentation and report of their plan to setup an assembly plant in Michigan for this drone. Students learned the assembly line design, cycle time balancing, time study, automation, robotics, ergonomics, process capability index, and plant layout. The final project is the design and manufacture of an attachment to a hobby drone, DJI F330, for a mission that will benefit society. Students learned the social-aspects of manufacturing, computer-aided design, additive manufacturing, fabrication skills, and manufacturing processes. Each team identified a societal need, designed an attachment to the DJI F330 drone, reviewed the design with experienced engineers, manufactured components, assembled the attachment, and evaluated them in drone test flights. This course was implemented in close collaboration with a local community college to share the lecture and lab materials as well as pedagogy in manufacturing to benefit the same cohort of high school graduates. This approach of integrated social science, manufacturing, and technical communication to teach manufacturing using drones and connect manufacturing and society were demonstrated to be effective for an introductory freshman engineering course. Freshman engineering students often experience tremendous changes and pressure in their first semester. The lecture, lab, and discussion session for communication were adjusted to help students’ transition in their first semester engineering study.",,Procedia Manufacturing,,,2020,2020,48,,1126-1135,All OA; Gold,Article,"Shih, Albert; Chen, Lei; Webster, Noah; Hogg, Alan","Shih, Albert (Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Michigan, 2350 Hayward St., Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, USA); Chen, Lei (Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Michigan, 2350 Hayward St., Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, USA); Webster, Noah (Institute of Social Research, University of Michigan, 426 Thompson St., Ann Arbor, MI, 48106, USA); Hogg, Alan (Program in Technical Communication, College of Engineering, University of Michigan, 2609 Draper Dr., Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, USA)",,"Shih, Albert (University of Michigan); Chen, Lei (University of Michigan); Webster, Noah (University of Michigan); Hogg, Alan (University of Michigan)",University of Michigan,grid.214458.e,United States,,0,0,,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.promfg.2020.05.154,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1128681094,09 Engineering; 10 Technology; 0910 Manufacturing Engineering; 1007 Nanotechnology,4 Quality Education

The performance is measured by the distance between the consumption rate and a fraction $0\leq\lambda\leq 1$ of the historical consumption maximum. To overcome its path-dependent nature, the consumption running maximum process is chosen as an auxiliary state process that renders the value function two dimensional depending on the wealth variable $x$ and the reference variable $h$. The associated Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation is expressed in the piecewise manner across different regions to take into account constraints. By employing the dual transform and smooth-fit principle, the classical solution of the HJB equation is obtained in an analytical form, which in turn provides the piecewise feedback optimal investment and consumption strategies.

Impaired clearance of inhaled microorganisms results in the establishment of chronic infection, triggering an overexaggerated inflammatory response. The resulting release of inflammatory cytokines and enzymes causes pulmonary damage in the form of bronchiectasis, further impairing mucociliary action, forming a vicious cycle.
